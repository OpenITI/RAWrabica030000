~~abstract ( ... the primary aim of the present paper is to investigate
~~the syntactic distribution of middle verbs in english. middle formation
~~seems to involve demotion of the external argument and promotion of the
~~internal argument to the grammatical subject position, as is the case in
~~passivisation. this paper is organized as follows. in section 1, we
~~offer a definition of the term “middle verb” and present some of its
~~distinguishing features. in section 2, we look into the question of
~~whether or not middles involve 0-roles. in section 3, we shed some light
~~on the nature of the empty category and the syntactic position external
~~arguments fill in middles. then in section 4, we examine whether middles
~~are the end-product of a movement operation. finally, in section 5, we
~~bring the paper to a close by concluding remarks to the effect that the
~~empty external 0-roles in middles syntactically emerge as pros.

~~أغوار السلوك النحوي لأفعال المطاوعة في الإنكليزية، إذ تتجلى صياغتها في
~~التقليل من شأن مركب اسمي خارجي وإبراز مركب اسمي داخلي يقوم مقام الفاعل،
~~كما هي الحال في المبني للمجهول. ويتم بناء هذه الورقة على النحو الآتي:
~~نقدم في القسم الأول تعريفا لمصطلح "فعل المطاوعة" ونبرز بعضا من خصائصه
~~المميزة. ونتطرق في القسم الثاني إلى مسألة احتواء أفعال المطاوعة لأدوار
~~محورية أو انتفائها. أما في القسم الثالث، فنقوم بتسليط الضوء على طبيعة
~~الصيغة الصامتة في تراكيب أفعال المطاوعة والموقع النحوي الذي تشغله
~~المركبات الاسمية الخارجية. ونبحث في القسم الرابع إمكانية عد تراكيب أفعال
~~المطاوعة نتاجا لعملية نقل. وأخيرا، نطوي هذه الورقة بعبارات ختامية مفادها
~~أن الأدوار المحورية الخارجية الصامتة في تراكيب أفعال المطاوعة تبرز
~~بوصفها حالات من "ضم الكبير". الكلمات المفتاحية: فعل مطاوعة، دور محوري،
~~مقولة فارغة، ضم(ير) الكبير، مبدأ الإسقاط. 1. introduction: middle verbs
~~are verbs which can be either transitive or intransitive. when
~~transitive, they can take an object and can also be made passive. when
~~intransitive, they do not take an object. look at these examples: (1)
~~a. the fire burned the house. – transitive/active b. the house was
~~burned by the fire. – transitive/passive ¬__________ (¬1) * أستاذ مساعد
~~في الألسنية، قسم اللغة الإنكليزية، كلية الآداب والعلوم الإنسانية، جامعة
~~تشرين، اللاذقية- سوريا. PageV01P0002
# c. the house burned. – intransitive/middle in sentence (1a) burned is
~~active because it has the object the house. in sentence (1b) was burned
~~is passive, with the house, the object of sentence (1a) becoming the
~~subject of the passive verb, and the fire becoming the agent. in
~~sentence (1c) burned is not transitive, because the house is the subject
~~and houses cannot burn anything. it is not passive, because there is no
~~passive construction. it is technically active, but also intransitive,
~~as there is no object. in effect, it shares both active and passive
~~features, which is why we refer to it as middle. following zwart
~~(1997:1), middle constructions can be defined by the following
~~properties: (2) i. the external argument of the verb is not expressed.
~~a.*this novel reads easily (*by anyone). ii. the verb has active
~~morphology. b.*this novel is read quickly. iii. the action denoted by
~~the verb is predicated over by an adverb. c.*this novel quickly reads.
~~iv. the verb is of the activity-class, and the sentence as a whole is
~~non-eventive.1 d.*fred is knowing the answer. in brief, middle
~~constructions are generated by a syntactic rule of move ? and are hence
~~transitive while in the lexicon. consider the following pair of
~~examples: (3) a. someone bribed the bureaucrats. b. bureaucrats bribed
~~easily. PageV01P0003
# in (3b), the determiner phrase (dp) in subject position is not the
~~agent but the theme of the verb. cited in keyser & roeper (1984:383),
~~fiengo (1980) observes that “ ... in middles and passives there is a
~~subject either stated or implied; in ‘the car was sold’ it is implied
~~that there was an agent of the sale’ and in ‘foreign cars sell easily’
~~the same is true. the sentences ‘the milk spilled’ and ‘the milk was
~~spilled,’ or ‘the tomato ripened’ and ‘the tomato was ripened,’ seem to
~~contrast in this respect, the ‘intransitives’ implying no agent.”2 ...
~~middles occur frequently, especially where bureaucratic language is at
~~issue: (4) a. spanish translates easily. b. the luggage transfers
~~efficiently. c. the goods will not transport easily d. signals transmit
~~rapidly. however, not all transitive verbs are equally grammatical in
~~the middle mode, as the following clearly illustrate: (5) a. *german
~~acquires easily. b. *the analyses claim easily. c. *the question learns
~~easily. d. *the question knows easily. these constructions are
~~grammatically fine, but semantically anomalous. moreover, middles cannot
~~occur in progressive constructions. take the following examples: (6) a.
~~*ducks are killing. b. *the surface is waxing. c. *these toys are
~~assembling. as these examples clearly indicate, middles behave like
~~stative verbs by not appearing in imperative or progressive
~~constructions, since neither middles nor stative verbs describe events:3
~~(7) a. *stefan is wanting the cake. b. *want the cake, stefan! c. *the
~~police are bribing. d. *bribe easily, the police! PageV01P0004
# ... what is particularly characteristic of middles is that they must
~~occur with adverbs: (8) a. *the police bribe. b. *the surface waxes. c.
~~*the car drives. despite the fact that there are instances of middles
~~like ‘the ferry sank,’ ‘the gate opened,’ which do not require
~~postmodifying adverbs, it is therefore required that an adverb be
~~present in order to instantiate the middle reading in (8). 2. do
~~middles involve 0(theta)-roles? a widely held property of middle
~~constructions is that the agent 0- roles (semantic roles played by
~~arguments in relation to their predicates) are void of phonetic content,
~~as illustrated in the following: (9) a. this novel reads nicely. b.
~~this cheque transfers easily. c. those cars sell quickly. fagan (1988)
~~and roberts (1986) ascribe the invisibility of these 0-roles to their
~~being syntactically suppressed, i.e. capped. the projection principle
~~(prpr) requires that the properties of lexical items should remain
~~constant throughout the derivation (cf. chomsky (1981)). with this in
~~mind, fagan and roberts claim that the agent 0-role of middle verbs
~~exhibit no phonological representation because it is lexically blocked
~~from having any syntactic representation.4 PageV01P0005
# however, stroik (1992) argues against the syntactic suppression
~~assumption by suggesting instead that the agent 0-role of middle verbs
~~in (9a-c) is assigned as a pro (in government-binding (gb) theory, a
~~null-case pronoun representing the understood subject of an infinitive
~~complement of a control predicate) argument that is structurally
~~realized as a vp adjunct, in line with, as we shall see, larson’s (1988)
~~principle of argument demotion. as a result, a movement analysis is
~~required for the externalization of the internal theme 0-roles in
~~(9a-c). stroik (1992:129) supports his analysis of the external 0-role
~~being structurally represented in middles with two arguments. firstly,
~~he draws on data from subject-contained anaphors, as in the following:
~~(10) a. stories about oneself read nicely. b. cards to oneself write
~~easily. c. rows with oneself end peacefully. PageV01P0006
# what the data in (10) clearly demonstrate is that anaphors can occupy
~~the superficial subject position of middles. the question that arises
~~here is: how are these anaphors sanctioned? following principle a of the
~~binding theory that anaphors must be a-bound in their governing
~~category, then for each anaphor in (10) to be properly bound, it must be
~~coindexed with a phonologically invisible dp capable of c-commanding the
~~anaphor. following belletti and rizzi (1988), the c-command relation is
~~operative at any syntactic level of representation. as is evident, there
~~are only two positions for this empty antecedent to occupy: either
~~within the subject np or within the vp. now if within the np, then,
~~following stowell’s (1989) analysis of the syntax of dps, the antecedent
~~could be the pro subject of the dp. this suggests that (10a) could have
~~(11) as its underlying structure. (11) [dp proi [n’ stories about
~~oneselfi ]] read nicely the subject-contained anaphor in (11) would be
~~properly bound by the arbitrary pro within the subject dp. ... appealing
~~though this analysis may be, it does pose serious problems. for one
~~thing, the way pro and oneself are indexed does indicate that the
~~subject dp should read as follows: ‘one’s stories about oneself,’ but
~~the subject dp in (10a) does not trigger this meaning. instead, the
~~subject np means ‘any (one’s) stories about oneself’ – where the
~~possessor subject np refers independently of oneself –i.e. arbitrarily.
~~thus, we do not expect a pro subject of the subject dp to be coindexed
~~with the anaphor, as in (12). ( PageV01P0007
# 12) [dp proi [n’ stories about oneselfj ]] read nicely the anaphor
~~oneself in (12) must not be bound within the subject dp. hence, for it
~~to be bound at all, it must be bound within the vp. for another thing,
~~this analysis predicts that if the pro position filled with an argument
~~in middles cannot function as an antecedent for a subject-contained
~~anaphor, then this will render the anaphor being left dangling –i.e.
~~unbound – hence the ungrammaticality of such middles. the following
~~data, taken from stroik (1992:130), serve to test the above-mentioned
~~prediction. (13) a. it seems that [today’s news about oneself] always
~~reads better than yesterday’s. *it seems that [today’s news about
~~oneself] amazes me more than yesterday’s. b.the candidates disagree so
~~much that [today’s negotiations with each other] will surely end
~~abruptly. *the candidates disagree so much that [today’s negotiations
~~with each other] will surely be criticised. to account for the
~~grammaticality would be to assume the presence of a nonovert antecedent
~~filling some other position than the subject dp position in (11). ...
~~additional support for the syntactic realization of the external 0-role
~~in middles is illustrated by the following: (14) a. that surface paints
~~quickly for stefan. b. no chinese text reads easily for nancy.
~~PageV01P0008
# the only possible reading for (14a-b) is to regard the prepositional
~~objects as agents: ‘stefan is the painter of the surface;’ ‘nancy is the
~~reader of the text.’ hence, we must conclude that the external 0-roles
~~are syntactically represented, contrary to what fagan and roberts have
~~claimed. hoekstra and roberts (1993) argue that the pp is the
~~experiencer argument of the adverb. however, for stroik (1999), the pp
~~is the demoted external argument of the middle verb. 3. the nature of
~~the empty category (ec) in middles: now, we need to consider the
~~features of the empty arguments in (10) and (13) and determine the exact
~~syntactic position the external arguments occupy. given gb assumptions,
~~each empty np argument in (9) has its own independent 0-role; it must be
~~(little) pro (a null nominative-case pronoun representing the understood
~~null subject of a finite clause in a null-subject language), (big) pro,
~~or an imp(licit) argument (cf. iwata (1999)). since english is a non-
~~null-subject language, the empty argument cannot be pro. the alternative
~~is that the empty arguments in (9) must be either pro or imp. we can now
~~draw on roberts’s (1986) analysis for distinguishing pro from imp.
~~roberts assumes that (i) imps cannot bind anaphors, but pros can, as in
~~(15); (ii) imps cannot be controlled, but pros can, as in (16); and
~~(iii) imps cannot control into adjuncts, but pros can, as in (17). (15)
~~a.*gifts were sent impi to themselvesi. b. they expected proi to send
~~gifts to one anotheri. (16) a.*theyi expected scandals to be mongered
~~impi. PageV01P0009
# b. theyi expected proi to monger scandals. (17) a.*the report was
~~written impi without proi due care. b. they expected proi to write the
~~report without proi due care. when we test the middles in (9) against
~~roberts’s three properties, we are led to believe that the empty
~~argument in middles functions like pro. consider the following data,
~~some of which repeated here for convenience, where, as we have seen,
~~middles permit their empty arguments to license anaphors. (18) a.
~~stories about oneselfi read nicely eci. b.it seems that [today’s news
~~about oneselfi] always reads better than yesterday’s eci. c. some poems
~~read better aloud to oneselfi than others do eci. under a dp-analysis
~~like (11), which would treat pro as the antecedent for the anaphor in
~~(18a), an ec would still be a prerequisite to making the presence of
~~anaphors licit in (18b). moreover, a dp-analysis cannot account for the
~~anaphor in (18c), which is not contained within the dp. (18c) suggests
~~that not only can middles have nonovert arguments –i.e. arguments whose
~~function is to bind the anaphors – but also that these arguments must be
~~pros, rather than imps, because they do not bind the anaphors.
~~roberts’s second property, which assumes that pros can be controlled,
~~lends support to the claim that the ec in middles is pro. take the
~~following examples: (19) a. billi expects the chinese text he was
~~assigned will not translate easily eci. b. cynthiai believes that people
~~think that talking to herself never ends quietly eci. c. jimi expects
~~that the car he has just bought will sell quickly eci. PageV01P0010
# what the data in (19) clearly show is that the ecs involved can all be
~~controlled by their respective coindexed antecedents, hence leading us
~~to conclude that they are pros, rather than imps. the third property
~~proposed by roberts identifies pro but not imp as a possible controller,
~~thus offering further evidence that the empty argument in middles is
~~pro, as illustrated in the following: (20) a. most linguistics
~~textbooks read poorly eci even after proi reading them several times. b.
~~beetroots usually peel easily eci after proi boiling them. c. clerks
~~bribe at best eci after proi doing them a couple of favours. having
~~determined that the external 0-role in middles is realised as a pro
~~argument, we still need to probe a little further into identifying the
~~nature of the syntactic position it normally occupies. that is, since
~~pro is ungoverned, the external 0-role in middles is expected to surface
~~in an a’-position –i.e. in an ungoverned position. put differently, it
~~cannot appear in a-position because such positions are governed by the
~~respective heads of given constructions. following larson’s (1988)
~~principle of argument demotion (pad), cited in stroik (1992:134), we can
~~account for the syntactic representation of the external 0-role in
~~middles, and consequently for its appearance in an ungoverned
~~a’-position. (21) principle of argument demotion: if a is a 0-role
~~assigned by xk, then a may be assigned (up to optimality) to an adjunct
~~of xk. PageV01P0011
# since the external 0-role in middles is assigned by the vp, the pad
~~would allow this 0-role to be downgraded from subject of tp (tense
~~phrase) to vp adjunct, thus permitting the sentence (22a) to have the
~~partial s-structure representation (22b). (22) a. clerks bribe easily.
~~b. [tp clerks [t’ t [vp [vp bribe easily] pro]]]] the facts the
~~construction in (22a) captures include: (i) middles take two arguments,
~~(agent, theme), represented syntactically; (ii) the external 0-role is
~~pro; (iii) the external 0-role does not emerge as the superficial
~~subject. in order for (22b) to be a plausible structural representation
~~of middles, we must, following stroik’s (1992, 1999) analysis, still
~~demonstrate that pro can occupy the vp adjunct position assigned in
~~(22b). PageV01P0012
# for pro to be able to be the downgraded external 0-role in (22b), it
~~has to appear ungoverned in its adjunct position. let’s assume chomsky’s
~~(1986b) barriers-definition of government to determine whether or not
~~pro is ungoverned. on this version, ? govern ? iff ?
~~m(aximally)-commands ? and there is no barrier for ?, and ? m-commands ?
~~iff ? does not dominate ?, and every maximal projection dominating ?
~~dominates ?. now, assuming that pro can be governed in (22b), then it
~~will have to be governed by one of two possible zero-level governors for
~~pro in (22b):t (tense) or v. despite t m-commands pro, it cannot govern
~~pro because of vp – hence vp is a blocking category between t and
~~anything within the vp, any pro for that matter. by the same token, v
~~cannot govern pro in (22b) because the verb in (22b) can govern pro if
~~it m-commands it. but given that the vp maximal projection dominates v
~~but not pro, v does not m-command pro and consequently cannot govern pro
~~either. since neither t nor v governs pro in (22b), pro is ungoverned,
~~and thus (22b) is a compatible representation for (22a). what we have
~~attempted to do so far is show that the external 0-roles in middles end
~~up as arguments relegated to becoming vp adjuncts. 4. do middles involve
~~movement? PageV01P0013
# following roberts (1986), we assume that middles are temporary non-
~~eventive verbs brought about by the failure of t-v coindexing. for him,
~~the failure of this process precludes the vp from using t to project its
~~external 0-role into the subject position. thus, the syntactically
~~represented external 0-role must be relegated. this demotion is
~~obligatory, hence (23a) is required to have (23b) at d-structure: (23)
~~a. stories about oneself always red nicely. b. [tp e [t’ t [vp [vp
~~always read stories about oneself nicely] pro]]]] as is clearly shown,
~~the theme argument must be underlyingly represented within the vp
~~because the theme is logically marked by the verb (i.e. it must be a
~~sister of v at d-structure). furthermore, following roberts (1986) and
~~larson (1988), we assume that v can assign accusative case only if
~~coindexed with t. given the absence of t-v coindexing in middles, the
~~verb cannot assign case to its object. naturally, the object must move
~~to the subject position to be case-marked.5 thus, (23a) will have (24)
~~as its corresponding s-structure representation: (24) [tp [ stories
~~about oneself]i [t’ t [vp [vp always read ti nicely] pro]]] ... as
~~already noted, middle formation hinges on two interwoven syntactic
~~processes: (i) agent relegation; and (ii) theme promotion. PageV01P0014
# ... anaphoric binding lends support for theme promotion. imagine the
~~original position for the theme were the subject position at
~~d-structure, then the anaphor in (23a) couldn’t have a c-commanding
~~antecedent higher up in the syntactic representation. however, following
~~belletti and rizzi’s (1988) proposal that anaphors can be bound at any
~~syntactic level, we can account for the anaphoric binding in (23a). on
~~this analysis, the anaphor in (23a) will be bound at d-structure, as
~~illustrated in (23b), being the level at which pro c-commands the
~~anaphor. ... if handling of anaphoric binding in middles with empty
~~external 0-roles is viable, then we would normally expect to find only
~~those anaphors in middles that are compatible with pro, hence the
~~following are ruled out: (25) a.*stories about himself always read
~~nicely. b.*faxes to themselves transmit quickly. c.*rows with herself
~~end dramatically. as we have seen, since the external arguments in
~~middles can overtly be represented, as in (14), it is predictable that
~~the anaphors sanctioned by fully realized external arguments must be in
~~agreement with the arguments, as demonstrated in (26): (26) a. stories
~~about himself read in no time for stefan. b.*stories about oneself read
~~in no time for martina. c.*stories about himself read in no time for
~~martina. d.*stories about themselves read in no time for stefan.
~~PageV01P0015
# the data in (26) clearly show that it is mandatory for anaphors to
~~share certain features with external arguments. this in turn
~~substantiates the analyses that require that anaphors be bound by
~~external arguments at d-structure –i.e. before the theme argument is
~~promoted to the subject position. 5. concluding remarks: ... responding
~~to roberts (1986) and fagan (1988), we have concluded that middle
~~formation is the product of two interrelated syntactic operations:
~~external 0-role demotion to a vp adjunction position and theme promotion
~~to the subject position,6 contrary to roberts’s and fagan’s handling of
~~the argument structure of a middle verb. our treatment of middles has
~~also predicted that the external 0-role can be either lexically realized
~~or covert, thus concluding that nonovert external 0-roles in middles are
~~syntactically realized as pros. notes: 1. for roberts (1986:196),
~~middles cannot be formed from state verbs because “middle formation is a
~~process of stativisation.” 2. zwart (1998:110-111) argues that the
~~subject of middles is generated in the external argument position of the
~~verb where it gets a causative interpretation (not an agentive one.
~~hence, the subject is not a raised internal argument, and instead the
~~adverbial is the complement of the verb. 3. verbs that denote states
~~never undergo middle formation in english: a. *this language
~~understands easily. b. *this story believes easily. PageV01P0016
# however, for rapoport (1999:149-150), only habitual middles entail the
~~existence of an event, as illustrated by the following: this editorial
~~reads daily. (habitual middle)where the adverbial explicitly refers to a
~~habit. 4. condoravdi (1989) has defined middles as involving generic
~~quantification over events, contrary to the analysis in fagan (1992),
~~where middles are argued to involve generic quantification over
~~subjects. 5. the claim that the object must be moved for case-marking
~~purposes is demonstrated by the following example, where the object dp
~~violates the case filter which requires that overt dps be case- marked
~~or be associated with a case-assigning position. *it never reads
~~stories about oneself nicely pro. 6. for ackema and schoorlemmer
~~(1995), any adequate theory of middles will have to explain how middles
~~can suppress their external arguments and yet remain transitive, and why
~~the syntactically suppressed external argument comes to be interpreted,
~~while the syntactically present reflexive pronoun doesn’t. references:
