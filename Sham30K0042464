~~would like to become a musilim. PageV01P0001
# i would like to become a musilim. is this possible? and if so, how can
~~this happen. i do not know much.i know some things. praise be to allaah.
~~any human being can embrace islam. you do not need anyone’s permission.
~~you simply say and believe that there is no god except allah and that
~~mohammad is his messenger. once you say this sentence, you automatically
~~become muslim. from there, you start carrying on with the duties of
~~islam. you must do what allah and his messenger tell you to, and stay
~~away from what they tell you to. islam does not tell you to do anything
~~unless it is good for you. it also does not tell you to stay away from
~~anything unless it is bad for you. you will notice the change in the way
~~you look at things, the minute you become a muslim. you will feel more
~~relieved and secure only to think that you are fulfilling the orders of
~~allah. doing this, you will clearly see the benefits of it for yourself
~~and for mankind. you can embrace islam in any islamic center. this is
~~only a formality. once you say and believe in the oneness of allah and
~~in the message of his prophet mohammad, then you are a muslim. to become
~~a muslim, simply say the following words: ash hadu alla ilaha illa
~~allah, wa ash hadu anna mohammadan abduhu wa rasuluhu. this means i
~~testify and witness that there is no god worthy of being worshipped
~~other than allah and that mohammad is his messenger. you must say it and
~~believe in it. assalamu alaikum (peace be upon you), i greet you with
~~the greeting of islam and welcome you to the best way of life.
~~PageV01P0002
# allah, the most beneficent, has shown you the path that leads to his
~~love and mercy. you've taken the sahada, the declaration of faith. right
~~now, you are among the most innocent people in the world. why? because,
~~as soon as you took the sahada, all your past sins were forgiven. no
~~matter what sin you've committed, all of them are now forgiven. from
~~this moment on, it is very important for you to keep yourself pure and
~~stay away from all types of evil deeds. try your best to do this, ask
~~allah to help you in whatever good you want to do. a muslim is he who
~~submits himself to the will of allah. meaning, you recognize your
~~creator and then you obey him in every aspect. allah has created you and
~~he knows what is good for you. the first thing you should do is to start
~~learning how to pray to allah. muslims pray 5 times a day to allah. my
~~dear friend, to a true muslim, these prayers are not a burden, but a
~~source of pleasure. say that you love somebody very much but the person
~~lives far away. so, you only communicate with the person by phone. now,
~~everytime you call that person, you feel a deep sensation of love. the
~~same way, a true muslim loves allah more than anyone. and when he stands
~~to offer his prayers, he feels the same way when a lover communicates
~~with the loved one. my friend, do you have a mosque nearby? if you do, i
~~suggest that you go there and find a good muslim friend to teach you
~~islam. i hope to hear back from you. may allah bless you with a life of
~~piety and make you among the people of paradise. be steadfast in islam,
~~and you will be successful. PageV01P0003
# كيف أصبح مسلما؟ i want to become a muslim but how how to become a
~~muslim based on a booklet by the cooperative office for call and
~~guidance - riyadh, saudi arabia all praise be to allah, the lord of the
~~universe. may peace and blessings of allah be upon mohammad, his last
~~messenger. the purpose of this hand-out is to correct a false idea
~~spread among those willing to adopt islam as their faith. some people
~~have a wrong notion that entering into the islamic fold requires an
~~announcement from the concerned person in the presence of high ranking
~~scholars or shaikhs or reporting this act to courts of justice or other
~~authorities. it is also thought that the act of accepting islam, should,
~~as a condition, have a certificate issued by the authorities, as
~~evidence to that effect. we wish to clarify that the whole matter is
~~very easy and that none of these conditions or obligations are required.
~~for allah, almighty, is above all comprehension and knows well the
~~secrets of all hearts. nevertheless, those who are going to adopt islam
~~as their religion are advised to register themselves as muslims with the
~~concerned governmental agency, as this procedure may facilitate for them
~~many matters including the possibility of performing hadj (pilgrimage)
~~and umrah. if anyone has a real desire to be a muslim and has full
~~conviction and strong belief that islam is the true religion ordained by
~~allah for all human-beings, then, one should pronounce the "shahada",
~~the testimony of faith, without further delay. PageV01P0004
# the holy qur'an is explicit on this regard as allah states: "the
~~religion in the sight of allah is islam" (qur'an 3:19) in another verse
~~of the holy qur'an, allah states: "if anyone desires a religion other
~~than islam (submission to allah), never will it be accepted of him; and
~~in the hereafter he will be in the ranks of those who have lost (their
~~selves in the hell fire)." (qur'an 3:85) in addition, islam is the only
~~religion prevailing over all other religions. allah states in the holy
~~qur'an: "to thee we sent the ******ure in truth, confirming the
~~******ure that came before it, and guarding it in safety:..." (qur'an
~~5:48) mohammad, the prophet of allah (peace and blessing of allah be
~~upon him), said: "the superstructure of islam is raised on five
~~(pillars): testifying that there is no god (none truely to be worshiped)
~~but allah, and that mohammad is the messenger of allah, performing the
~~prayer, paying the zakah (poor-due), fasting the month of ramadan, and
~~performing hadj". the shahada can be declared as follows: "ash-hadu anla
~~elaha illa-allah wa ash-hadu anna mohammadan rasul-allah". the english
~~translation is: "i bear witness that there is none worthy of worship but
~~allah, and i bear witness that mohammad is the messenger of allah
~~however, it would not be sufficient for anyone to only utter this
~~testimony oraly either in private or in public; but rather, he should
~~believe in it by heart with a firm conviction and unshakeable faith. if
~~one is truly sincere and complies with the teachings of islam in all his
~~life, he will find himself a new born person. PageV01P0005
# this will move him to strive more and more to improve his character
~~and draw nearer to perfection. the light of the living faith will fill
~~his heart until he becomes the embodiment of that faith. what would be
~~next after declaring oneself a muslim? one should then know the real
~~concept underlying this testimony which means the oneness of allah and
~~meet its requirements. one must behave accordingly, applying this true
~~faith to every thing one speaks or does. what do the words of the
~~"shahada" signify? the significant point which every muslim must know
~~very well is the truth that there is no god (deity) to be worshipped
~~other than allah. he - glory be to him - is the only true god, who alone
~~deserves to be worshipped, since he is the giver of life and sustainer
~~and nourisher of mankind and all creation with his unlimited bounties.
~~man must worship allah, who alone is worthy of worship. the second part
~~of the shahada (i.e., wa ash-hadu anna mohammadan rasul-allah) means
~~that prophet mohammad (pbuh) is the servant and chosen messenger of
~~allah. no one must have two opinions about this matter. in fact the
~~muslim has to obey the commands of the prophet (pbuh), to believe him in
~~what he has said, to practice his teachings, to avoid what he has
~~forbidden, and to worship allah alone according to the message revealed
~~to him, for all the teachings of the prophet were in fact revelations
~~and inspirations conveyed to him by allah. what is the meaning of
~~worship? it simply means rendering sincere service, showing reverence
~~for allah. PageV01P0006
# in a deeper shade of meaning, it implies total submission and complete
~~obedience to allah's commandments both in utterances and actions of man
~~whether explicit or implicit. worship fall into two categories: visible
~~(manifest or outward) invisible (concealed or inward) visible worship
~~includes acts such as uttering the two parts of the "shahada",
~~performing prayers, giving zakah (the poor-due), recitation of the holy
~~qur'an, supplication, adoring allah by praising him, purifying our
~~bodies before prayers, etc. this type of worship is associated with
~~movement of the parts of the human body. invisible worship is to believe
~~in allah, in the day of judgement (in the hereafter), in the angels, in
~~the books of allah, in the prophets of allah, in the divine decree of
~~destiny (that good and bad are determined by allah alone). this type of
~~worship does not involve movement of parts of the body but it surely has
~~bearing on one's heart which subsequently affects one's way of life. it
~~should be borne in mind that any worship not dedicated to allah alone
~~will be rejected as one form of polytheism and this causes apostasy from
~~the islamic fold. the next step for a newly revert to islam is to purify
~~himself by taking a complete bath. he should then resolve to comply with
~~the principles and rules of islam in their entirety. he should disown
~~all forms of polytheism and false beliefs. he should reject evil and be
~~righteous. such rejection of evil and being righteous is one of the
~~equisites of the motto of islam - that is, laa ilaha illallah. allah
~~states in the holy qur'an: "... PageV01P0007
# whoever rejects evil and believes in allah hath grasped the most
~~trustworthy hand-hold, that never breaks..." (qur'an 2:256) we have to
~~consider that when we declare from our heart that "there is no god
~~(deity) worthy to be worshipped but allah", it implies on our part love,
~~devotion, faith and obedience to the rules of islamic legislations which
~~are legally binding on all muslims. it is a requirement of "there is no
~~god worthy to be worshipped but allah" to love for the sake of allah and
~~to reject for the sake of allah. this is the firmest anchor of belief
~~which materialise the meaning of "al wala" and "al bara". it means that
~~a muslim should love and be loyal to his muslim brothers. he should, as
~~a practice, dissociate himself completely from the unbelievers and
~~refuse to be influenced by them, both in worldly and religious matters.
~~we conclude with a humble prayer to allah that may he cleanse the hearts
~~and souls of those who are genuine seekers of truth and may he bless the
~~community of believers. aameen. 2- لماذا تعتنق النساء الإسلام؟ why are
~~women turning to islam PageV01P0008
# why are women turning to islam at a time when islam is faced with
~~hostile media coverage particularly where the status of women in islam
~~is concerned, it may be quite surprising to learn that islam is the
~~fastest growing religion in the world, and even more ironic to discover
~~that the majority of converts to islam are women . the status of women
~~in society is neither a new issue, nor is it a fully settled one. and
~~where islam is mentioned, for many the term 'muslim women' prompts
~~images of exhausted mothers chained to the stove, 'victims' suppressed
~~in a life of indoctrination, frantic to be westernized and so on. others
~~will go to great lengths to explain how the hijaab is an obstacle,
~~clouding the mind, and comment that female converts are either
~~brainwashed, stupid or traitors to their sex. i reject such accusations
~~and pose to them the following question: why is it that so many women
~~who have been born and brought in the so called 'civilized' societies of
~~europe and america are willing to reject their 'liberty' and
~~'independence' to embrace a religion that supposedly oppresses them and
~~is widely assumed to be prejudicial to them? as a christian convert to
~~islam, i can only present my personal experience and reasons for
~~rejecting the 'freedom' that women claim to have in this society in
~~favour of the only religion that truly liberates women by giving us a
~~status and position, which is completely unique when compared with that
~~of our non-muslim counterparts. PageV01P0009
# before coming to islam, i had strong feminist tendencies and
~~recognized that where a woman was concerned, a lot of shuffling around
~~had been going on, yet without being able to pin her on the social map.
~~the problem was ongoing: new 'women's issues' being raised without the
~~previous ones being satisfactorily resolved. like the many women who
~~shared my background, i would accuse islam of being a sexist religion,
~~discriminating, oppressing and giving men the greater privileges. all of
~~this, coming from a person who did not even know islam, one who had been
~~blinded due to ignorance and had accepted this deliberately distorted
~~definition of islam. however, despite my criticisms of islam, inwardly,
~~i wasn't satisfied with my own status as a woman in this society. it
~~seemed to me that society would define such terms as 'liberty' and
~~'freedom' and then these definitions were accepted by women without us
~~even attempting to question or challenge them. there was clearly a great
~~contradiction between what women were told in theory and what actually
~~happened in practice. the more i pondered, the greater emptiness i felt
~~within. i was slowly beginning to reach a stage where my dissatisfaction
~~with my status as a women in this society, was really a reflection of my
~~greater dissatisfaction with society itself. everything seemed to be
~~degenerating backwards, despite the claims that the 1990's was going to
~~be the decade of success and prosperity. something vital seemed to be
~~missing from my life and nothing would fill this vacuum. PageV01P0010
# being a christian did not do anything for me, and i began to question
~~the validity of only remembering god one day a week - sundays! as with
~~many other christians too, i had become disillusioned with the hypocrisy
~~of the church and was becoming increasingly unhappy with the concept of
~~trinity and the deification of jesus. eventually, i began to look into
~~islam. at first, i was only interested in looking at those issues, which
~~specifically dealt with women. i was surprised. what i read and learned,
~~taught me a lot about myself as a woman, and also about where the real
~~oppression of a woman lies: in every other system and way of life
~~outside of islam. muslim women have been given their rights in every
~~aspect of the religion with clear definitions of their role in society -
~~as had men - with no injustice against either of them. as allah says:
~~«"whoever does deeds of righteousness, be they male or female, and have
~~faith, they will enter paradise and not the least injustice will be done
~~to them"» [nisaa 4:124] so having amended my misconceptions about the
~~true status of women in islam, i was now looking further. i wanted to
~~find that thing which was going to fill the vacuum in my life. my
~~attention was drawn towards the beliefs and practices of islam. it was
~~only through establishing the fundamentals that i would understand where
~~to turn and what to prioritize. PageV01P0011
# these are often the areas, which receive little attention or
~~controversy in society, and when studying the islamic creed, it becomes
~~clear why this is the case: such concise, faultless and wholly
~~comprehensive details cannot be found elsewhere. 26- الإسلام ليس فقط
~~للعرب 26- islam is not just for arabs PageV01P0012
# islam is not just for arabs the truth of islam is meant for all people
~~regardless of race, nationality or linguistic background. taking a look
~~at the muslim world, from nigeria to bosnia and from malaysia to
~~afghanistan is enough to prove that islam is a universal message for all
~~of mankind --- not to mention the fact that significant numbers of
~~europeans and americans of all races and ethnic backgrounds are coming
~~into islam. every religion claims that it is the truth (the criteria of
~~the truth) there are so many sects, cults, religions, philosophies, and
~~movements in the world, all of which claim to be the right way or the
~~only true path to allah (god). how can one determine which one is
~~correct or if, in fact, all are correct? the method by which the answer
~~can be found is to clear away the superficial differences in the
~~teachings of the various claimants to the ultimate truth, and identify
~~the central object of worship to which they call, directly or
~~indirectly. false religions all have in common one basic concept with
~~regards to allah. they either claim that all men are gods or that
~~specific men were allah or that nature is allah or that allah is a
~~figment of man's imagination. thus, it may be stated that the basic
~~message of false religion is that allah may be worshipped in the form of
~~his creation. false religion invites man to the worship of creation by
~~calling the creation or some aspect of it god. PageV01P0013
# for example, prophet jesus invited his followers to worship allah but
~~those who claim to be his followers today call people to worship jesus,
~~claiming that he was allah! buddha was a reformer who introduced a
~~number of humanistic principles to the religion of india. he did not
~~claim to be god nor did he suggest to his followers that he be an object
~~of worship. yet, today most buddhists who are to be found outside of
~~india have taken him to be god and prostrate to idols made in their
~~perception of his likeness. by using the principle of identifying the
~~object of worship, false religion becomes very obvious and the contrived
~~nature of their origin clear. as god said in the our'aan: that which you
~~worship besides him are only names you and your forefathers have
~~invented for which allah has sent down no authority: the command belongs
~~only to allah: he has commanded that you only worship him; that is the
~~right religion, but most men do not understand ". (soorah yoosuf 12:40)
~~it may be argued that all religions teach good things so why should it
~~matter which one we follow. the reply is that all false religions teach
~~the greatest evil, the worship of creation. creation-worship is the
~~greatest sin that man can commit because it contradicts the very purpose
~~of his creation. man was created to worship allah alone as allah has
~~explicitly stated in the our'aan: "i have only created jinns and men,
~~that they may worship me"(soorah zaareeyaat 51:56) consequently, the
~~worship of creation, which is the essence of idolatry, is the only
~~unforgivable sin. PageV01P0014
# one who dies in this state of idolatry has sealed his fate in the next
~~life. this is not an opinion, but a revealed fact stated by allah in his
~~final revelation to man: the following criteria can best serve as a
~~gauge to find out the authenticity of the last revelation (the qur'an)
~~as words of god: 1. rational teachings: since our creator bestowed
~~reason and intellect upon us, it is our duty to use it to distinguish
~~the truth from falsehood. true, undistorted revelation from god must be
~~rational and can be reasoned out by all unbiased minds. 2. perfection:
~~since our creator is all perfect, his revelation must be perfect and
~~accurate, free from mistakes, omissions, interpolations and multiplicity
~~of versions. it should be free from contradictions in its narration. 3.
~~no myths or superstitions: true revelation is free from myths or
~~superstitions that degrade the dignity of our creator or man himself. 4.
~~scientific: since our creator is the creator of all knowledge, true
~~revelation is scientific and can withstand the challenge of science at
~~all times. 5. factual prophecy: our creator is the knower of the past,
~~present and future. thus his prophecies in his revelation will be
~~fulfilled as prophesied. 6. inimitable by man: true revelation is
~~infallible and cannot be imitated by man. god's true revelation is a
~~living miracle, an open book challenging all mankind to see and prove
~~for themselves its authenticity or veracity. 1- لمن يبحث عن الحقيقة 1-
~~the light of truth PageV01P0015
# the light of truth what is life? man's existence in this world and the
~~creation of this entire universe are not mere accidents or products of a
~~fortuitous nature. this universe, every single atom of it, manifests and
~~leads us to the realization of a loving, merciful and all-powerful
~~creator. without a creator, nothing can exist. every single soul knows
~~that he is existing and that his existence is dependent upon a creator
~~he knows for sure that he cannot create himself. therefore it is his
~~duty to know his master, the creator. mankind: man is a unique creature.
~~god gave man the ability to govern over all other creatures in this
~~world. he is endowed with the faculty of reason which sets him apart
~~from all other animals. together with this faculty to discriminate and
~~discern, man is given the freedom (free-will) to choose for himself a
~~way of life worthy of his position or to fall lower than the lowest of
~~all animals or creations. man is born pure and sinless and is given the
~~choice to do righteous deeds or indulge in sins. divine guidance: the
~~creator, out of his abundant love and mercy for mankind has not left us
~~in darkness to discover the right path by trial and error alone. coupled
~~with our intellectual capability to reason, our creator bestowed upon us
~~divine guidance that outlines the criterion for truth, knowledge, as
~~well as the reality of our existence in this world and the hereafter.
~~revelations: from the beginning of mankind, our creator sent prophets to
~~convey his revelation and to invite human beings to the path of true
~~peace and obedience to the one true god. PageV01P0016
# this is islam. this message is conveyed towards successive generations
~~of man through the different prophets, all inviting mankind to the same
~~path. however all the earlier messages or revelations from god were
~~distorted by people of later generations. as a result of this
~~distortion, pure revelation from our creator was adulterated and
~~polluted with myths, superstitions, idol worship and irrational
~~philosophical ideologies. the religion of god in a sense was lost in a
~~plethora of religions. human history is a testament of man's drift
~~between light and darkness, but god out of his abundant love for mankind
~~has not forsaken us. final revelation: when mankind was in the depths of
~~the dark ages, our creator sent his final messenger, prophet muhammad
~~(sallallahu ‘alaihi wa sallam) to redeem humanity with the final
~~revelation which represents the ultimate and permanent source of
~~guidance for the whole world. criteria for truth: the following criteria
~~can best serve as a gauge to find out the authenticity of the last
~~revelation (the qur'aan) as the word of god: rational teachings: since
~~our creator bestowed reason and intellect upon us, it is our duty to use
~~it to distinguish the truth from falsehood. true, undistorted revelation
~~from god must be rational and can be reasoned out by all unbiased minds.
~~perfection: since our creator is all perfect, his revelation must be
~~perfect and accurate, free from mistakes, omissions, interpolations and
~~multiplicity of versions. it should be free from contradictions in its
~~narration. PageV01P0017
# no myths or superstitions: true revelation is free from myths or
~~superstitions that degrade the dignity of our creator or man himself.
~~scientific: since our creator is the creator of all knowledge, true
~~revelation is scientific and can withstand the challenge of science at
~~all times. factual prophecy: our creator is the knower of the past,
~~present and future. thus his prophecies in his revelation will be
~~fulfilled as prophesied. inimitable by man: true revelation is
~~infallible and cannot be imitated by man. god's true revelation is a
~~living miracle, an open book challenging all mankind to see and prove
~~for themselves its authenticity or veracity المصدر http://www.what-
~~islam.com/ 2- لماذا يجب على الايمان والخضوع لقوانين الخالق؟ 2- why
~~should i? PageV01P0018
# why should i? what is the matter with the world today? why all the
~~chaos? why all the evil? some people say there is no god; others say god
~~created man then left him alone to do as he pleases; yet others say that
~~they just do not know. what is the reality? the islamic view of human
~~nature is that, left to its own devices, humankind has an instinct of
~~what is right and wrong. this comes from an inner consciousness, a part
~~of us right down deep inside that senses truth from falsehood and
~~morality from immorality—even if we do not necessarily act according to
~~that innate knowledge. it is this consciousness that separates man from
~~the animals—the sense of responsibility of what is right and true, and
~~what is not. however, it does not stop there—not only does man have the
~~sense of what is right, he also has the means to do it. why should man
~~do what is right? has man received some kind of responsibility on his
~~shoulders? in islam, the answer is simply “yes.” allah tells muslims in
~~the qur’an what means: {lo! we offered the trust unto the heavens and
~~the earth and the hills, but they shrank from bearing it and were afraid
~~of it. and man assumed it. lo! he hath proved a tyrant and a fool.} (al-
~~ahzab 33:72) why did the heavens and earth refuse to take on this huge
~~responsibility? the answer is that they just could not imagine having
~~the choice to disobey the creator and cherisher of all the worlds, the
~~owner of the day of judgment. that they could put themselves in the
~~position of possibly entering hellfire and denied the mercy of allah was
~~simply unthinkable. PageV01P0019
# however, before we were born, all of humankind was made witness to the
~~reality of the creator and mankind’s role on earth, and we accepted the
~~responsibility of free will and thus, it is now a part of our souls—our
~~consciousness. we cannot escape it. therefore, man has the
~~responsibility to facilitate order in this world, and his own soul bears
~~witness to it, as do all the elements of nature surrounding him. humans
~~feel calm and at peace besides elements of nature like rivers,
~~waterfalls, mountains, and the sea, because nature submits to its lord
~~and achieves a state of islam (submission and peace), and we feel that
~~peace. why does man then ignore this responsibility despite all the
~~obvious proofs of its existence and his ability to fulfill it? the
~~answer is simple—he is living under an illusion: the illusion that he is
~~free in the sense that he will not be held accountable for his deeds and
~~days on earth. the truth is that man has misunderstood his mission in
~~life and forgotten that there are always consequences to every word and
~~action. how can man be completely free when there are always
~~consequences to what we say and do? there are two kinds of people in the
~~world: if there is an oil spill and a vast amount of nature is spoiled,
~~one kind of person shrugs his shoulders and says, “so what! it doesn’t
~~bother me.” such a person shows his ignorance and will live with the
~~consequences of his apathy as the world’s resources become less and
~~less. PageV01P0020
# however, another kind of person begins clean-up campaigns, joins
~~environmental organizations, or at least talks about that crime against
~~nature. these people are universally respected. therefore, human
~~responsibility does exist, but some people just choose to ignore it.
~~allah gave man eyes, ears, and all his faculties—everything he needs to
~~be well equipped to fulfill his responsibilities in life. because he is
~~just, allah also gave man instructions (through the prophets and divine
~~books) of what he should do with all these wonderful faculties. our eyes
~~enable us to see the beauty that surrounds us and to see when danger is
~~approaching, but if we look directly at the sun we will be blinded. are
~~we free? is there a right way and a wrong way to use our eyes? our ears?
~~ours limbs? our minds? we tell our children many things because of our
~~love for them and our desire to protect them from harm. we want them to
~~fulfill their potential. when we are present at home, they are much more
~~likely to obey us. but what about when we are not home? they can choose
~~to obey or to disobey—that is the extent of their freedom. if they
~~choose to obey us, even though we are not present, this is a sure sign
~~that the message we gave them has entered their hearts and that their
~~obedience is not due to fear. such obedience means that they understand
~~the meaning of the message and they recognize that it is for their own
~~benefit. PageV01P0021
# do we acknowledge the benefit in allah’s instructions to us? how far
~~has the divine message penetrated our hearts? this is like the message
~~allah gave to adam (peace be upon him). allah told adam and hawwa’ (eve)
~~to enjoy everything in the garden, but he the most merciful warned them
~~not to go near a certain tree or there would be consequences. this is
~~where the role of satan comes in. satan uses man’s dislike for
~~restrictions to enter his heart and confuse him. he works on man’s human
~~desire to be free and he feeds it. it is an inherent part of man’s
~~nature to resist restrictions, but just because it is a part of his
~~nature, it does not mean he can leave it to fester within him. we could
~~also say that anger is a part of man’s nature, but we are all aware of
~~the negative consequences of anger—likewise, man must struggle against
~~his resistance to commands and orders. adam and hawwa’ (peace be upon
~~them) chose to disobey. they were free to choose and there were
~~consequences. man’s lack of conscience spreads chaos throughout the
~~universe because of the illusion that he is free and will have no
~~consequences for his words and actions. how true is this idea? it is
~~widely acknowledged that all citizens have the responsibility to
~~contribute to the growth and development of their country. PageV01P0022
# what about our responsibility to ourselves, our responsibility to our
~~family, our responsibility to the earth, and our responsibility to our
~~creator? how can we say we are free? how can we say we have no
~~responsibility? the concept of the day of judgment, a day on which
~~everyone will be given what he or she deserves is described in the
~~qur’an: {and in like manner we disclosed them (to the people of the
~~city) that they might know that the promise of allah is true, and that,
~~as for the hour, there is no doubt concerning it. } (al-kahf 18:21) we
~~want to enter that final examination (day of judgment) as believers.
~~what is the state of the believer? the believer is the person who obeys
~~allah even if he does not necessarily understand or perceive. for
~~example, the believer believes in the existence of the angels even
~~though he cannot see them. why? because he has respect for the lawgiver.
~~the source of this respect is deep within his own soul if he only cares
~~to see it. nevertheless, he has the choice to take up this
~~responsibility or to leave it. he can either submit with a knowing,
~~gentle heart that sees the marvels of creation, the worth of his own
~~self, the majesty of the creator, and bow his head in gratitude and
~~obedience. the other option is that he can twist his head in haughty
~~pride, clinging to his illusion of being free, although recognizing the
~~truth of matters and the need for reform, and say “why should i?” source

~~PageV01P0023
# happiness in islam the meaning of happiness in islam happiness is a
~~feeling that resides in the heart. it is characterized by peace of mind,
~~tranquility, a sense of well-being, and a relaxed disposition. it comes
~~as a result of proper behavior, both inward and outward, and is inspired
~~by strong faith. this is attested to by the qur’ân and sunnah. allah
~~says: - whoever works righteousness as a believer, whether male or
~~female, we will give a good life. - then, whoever follows my guidance
~~shall neither go astray nor be distressed. but whoever turns away from
~~my reminder will have a life of hardship. allah’s messenger (peace be
~~upon him) said: “true enrichment does not come through possessing a lot
~~of wealth, but true enrichment is the enrichment of the soul.” happiness
~~is not restricted to material things from an islamic viewpoint,
~~happiness is not restricted to material prosperity, though material
~~reasons make up some of the elements of happiness. the material aspect
~~is merely a means, but not the end in itself. thus, the focus in
~~attaining happiness is on nonmaterial, more abstract concerns, like the
~~positive effects of good behavior. allah says: - and the cattle, he has
~~created them for you; in them there is warm clothing and numerous
~~benefits, and from them you eat. there is beauty in them for you when
~~you bring them home in the evening and when you lead them to pasture in
~~the morning. PageV01P0024
# - say (o muhammad): “who has forbidden the adornment given by allah
~~that he has brought forth for his servants, and the good things of
~~sustenance?” say: “they are, in the life of this world, for those who
~~believe, and exclusively for them on the day of resurrection.” allah’s
~~messenger (peace be upon him) said: “among the things that can bring
~~happiness to the son of adam are a pious wife, a good home, and a good
~~means of transport.” islam ensures eternal happiness for humanity islam
~~comes with a complete way of life. it provides rules and procedures to
~~prepare a person for life in both this world and the next. in this way,
~~islam ensures a person’s well being in this world as well as in the life
~~to come. islam comes to protect the highest needs of man: life, reason,
~~wealth, lineage, and faith. happiness, from an islamic perspective,
~~occurs on two levels: 1. worldly happiness: islamic law lays down a
~~number of injunctions and regulations to guarantee man’s happiness
~~during his worldly life, which is his first life. at the same time,
~~islam emphasizes that the life of this world is nothing more than a
~~means of attaining the hereafter, which is the true life that we all
~~must strive to attain. allah says: - whoever works righteousness as a
~~believer, whether male or female, we will give a good life. - seek, with
~~what allah has given you, the abode of the hereafter, and do not forget
~~your share of this world. - little are the enjoyments of the life of
~~this world as compared to the hereafter. 2. eternal happiness: this is
~~the true, lasting happiness. PageV01P0025
# this happiness depends on the righteousness of the individual in his
~~worldly life. allah says: - those whose lives the angels take while they
~~are in a pious state, to them the angels will say: ‘peace be upon you.
~~enter paradise because of that which you used to do. - for those who do
~~good in this world, there is good, and the abode of the hereafter will
~~be better; and excellent indeed will be the abode of the pious. the life
~~of this world is not an earthly paradise islam has clearly defined the
~~role of the human being on earth. it has made him vicegerent therein,
~~whereby he must strive to inhabit and develop the earth, bring about
~~prosperity, and work for the best interests of mankind in this world.
~~these noble objectives are surrounded by difficulties and require man to
~~exert a lot of effort and to bear heavy burdens in order to fulfill
~~them. life is not always as easy and simple as we would wish it to be.
~~quite the contrary, it goes from being easy to being very difficult,
~~just like a person goes from being healthy to being ill or from being
~~poor to being rich and vice versa. man must constantly deal with these
~~trials throughout his life. in this way, he can realize the noblest
~~qualities that these trials demand from him, like patience, willpower,
~~determination, courage, reliance upon allah, industry, and good morals.
~~these qualities are among the greatest sources of tranquility, peace of
~~mind, and happiness. PageV01P0026
# allah says: surely, we will try you with something of fear, hunger and
~~loss of wealth, lives, and the fruits of your labor, but give glad
~~tidings to the patient ones; who, when afflicted with calamity say, ‘to
~~allah we belong and to him we shall return.’ these are the ones who will
~~receive blessings and mercy from their lord, and these are the ones who
~~are rightly guided. allah’s messenger (peace be upon him) said: “how
~~astonishing is the affair of the believer. all of his affairs turn out
~~for the best. if goodness befalls him, he is thankful and this is good
~~for him, and if ill fortune befalls him, he is patient and this is good
~~for him السعادة في الإسلام (الجزء الثاني) happiness in islam - part 2
~~PageV01P0027
# happiness in islam means of attaining happiness 1. faith and good
~~works: faith brings about happiness in many ways: a. a person who
~~believes in allah alone without associating with him any partner, with a
~~belief that is pure and free from any defects, will enjoy a tranquil
~~heart, a peaceful soul, and will not be full of worry and anxiety over
~~life. he will be pleased with whatever allah has ordained for him;
~~thankful for all the good things in his life and patient with
~~misfortune. the submission of a believer to allah gives him the peace of
~~mind that a person needs in order to be industrious and hard working.
~~this is because he senses that his life has meaning and a definite
~~purpose that he must strive to achieve. allah says: those who believe
~~and do not mix their belief with iniquity, for them there is security
~~and they are the rightly guided. b. faith gives a person an ideal to
~~strive for. his life is invested with a higher meaning that inspires him
~~to work and expend his efforts in order to realize it. this keeps him
~~away from living a narrow, selfish life. he instead lives his life for
~~the good of others in the society in which he lives. a person who lives
~~only for himself finds his days shortened and his goals constrained.
~~when he, instead, lives for the ideal that inspires him, his life
~~appears long and beautiful, beginning with the dawn of humanity and
~~continuing long after he leaves the earth. this enhances his perception
~~of the moments, hours, and days of his life. c. PageV01P0028
# faith is not only a means to attain happiness; it is also a means to
~~ward off the things that prevent happiness. this is because the believer
~~knows that he is going to be tried and tested throughout his life and
~~that these trials are opportunities for him to put his faith into
~~practice. they help the believer to develop inner strength through the
~~noble qualities of patience and determination, and through trusting in
~~allah, seeking his assistance, and fearing him alone. these qualities
~~are some of the most effective ways of realizing the objectives of life,
~~and of bearing life’s trials. allah says: if you are suffering, then
~~they too are suffering as you are, but you hope from allah what they do
~~not hope for. 2. high moral standards that inspire one to do good for
~~others: man is a social being who needs to interact with beings of his
~~own kind. it is not possible for him to exist independently of others in
~~every aspect of his life. interacting with others is unavoidable, and
~~people differ greatly in their physical and mental peculiarities. thus,
~~it is unavoidable that displeasing things will happen between people
~~that can cause them sorrow and distress. if a person cannot deal with
~~these things in an honorable manner, then his interaction with others –
~~which in and of itself is unavoidable – will be a great source of
~~distress and misery for his life. for this reason, islam emphasizes
~~morality and the development of moral character. allah says, describing
~~the messenger (peace be upon him): - and verily you (o muhammad) are of
~~an exalted standard of character. PageV01P0029
# - and by the mercy of allah, you dealt with them gently. and had you
~~been severe and hard-hearted, they would have dispersed from around you;
~~so overlook their faults and ask allah’s for their forgiveness; and
~~consult them in affairs. allah says: - help one another in virtue and
~~piety, and do not help one another in sin and transgression. - the good
~~deed and the evil deed are not equal. repel evil with that which is
~~better, then verily the one between whom and you there was enmity will
~~become as if he was a close friend. allah’s messenger (peace be upon
~~him) said: “i was only sent to perfect moral character.” allah’s
~~messenger (peace be upon him) said: “the similitude of the believer in
~~his affection and mercy towards other believers is like that of one
~~body; if any part of it feels pain, the whole body becomes feverish and
~~restless.” 3. remembering allah often and constantly being aware of his
~~presence: a person’s satisfaction with another depends on the esteem
~~that he has for him. allah is the greatest source of peace for the
~~heart, and the one whose remembrance can bring joy to the soul.
~~remembrance of allah is the pleasure and comfort of the believer while
~~attaining what benefits him and avoiding what harms him. for this
~~reason, islamic law prescribes a number of specific remembrances to
~~relate the muslim back to his lord whatever the circumstance, in every
~~place, and at all times, when hoping for something desired, or fearing
~~something disliked. PageV01P0030
# these remembrances connect the believer’s conscience with his creator,
~~so he sees beyond the cause and effect relationships in the world around
~~him. consequently, he does not exaggerate their importance so much that
~~they can disturb his spirit. he does no exalt the worldly causes of
~~things beyond their limits, because he realizes that these causes in and
~~of themselves have no effect, but their effects come only by the decree
~~of allah. allah says: verily, in the remembrance of allah hearts find
~~rest. the prophet (peace be upon him) commanded the muslim man to say
~~when getting married to a woman: “o allah, i ask of you the goodness
~~within her and the goodness that you have made her inclined towards, and
~~i seek refuge with you from the evil within her and the evil that you
~~have made her inclined towards.” the muslim should say when the wind
~~begins to blow fiercely: “o allah i ask you for the good of it, the good
~~that it contains, and the good that it was sent with; and i seek refuge
~~with you from its evil, the evil within it, and the evil that it was
~~sent with.” allah’s messenger (peace be upon him) spoke of the necessity
~~of taking proper action to accomplish what one wants to accomplish,
~~seeking the help of allah, and not grieving if the results are not the
~~ones that were hoped for. he said: “strive for what benefits you and
~~seek the help of allah and do not behave as if you are incapable. and do
~~not say, ‘if only i had done this or that, it would have been this way
~~or that.’ instead say, ‘allah decreed what he decreed and what he wishes
~~to do he does. PageV01P0031
# ’ otherwise, you open the way for satan’s handiwork.” 4. maintaining
~~one’s health: this covers all aspects of health: physical, emotional,
~~mental and spiritual. physical health: man is naturally concerned with
~~preserving his physical health, this being part of his instinct to
~~survive. it is also a means of realizing his worldly aims of attaining
~~food, drink, clothing, and transportation. islam is concerned with man’s
~~survival and physical health. it forbids murder and prohibits consuming
~~things that are hazardous to one’s health. allah says: do not kill a
~~person – whose life allah has made sacred – except in the dispensation
~~of justice. allah’s messenger (peace be upon him) says: “there shall be
~~no harm nor causing of harm.” emotional health: many people are heedless
~~of the importance of emotional health and are equally heedless of the
~~way to take care of it, in spite of the fact that it a basic pillar of
~~happiness. for this reason, islam strives to develop a person’s inner
~~state in the best manner, purifying it with noble qualities. one of the
~~most important matters here is the development of a balanced,
~~harmonious, and composed emotional makeup. the basis for an upright
~~emotional character is, first and foremost, faith. thereafter come the
~~other important elements of an upright emotional character, like
~~possessing a high standard of morality and avoiding ignoble traits like
~~anger, pride, conceit, stinginess, worldly ardor, envy, and malice,
~~traits that can only lead to emotional instability and anxiety.
~~PageV01P0032
# allah says: - do not strain your eyes in longing for the things that
~~we have given to some groups of them to enjoy, the splendor of the life
~~of this world, through which we test them. but the provision of your
~~lord is better and more lasting. - o you who believe, let not one group
~~scoff at another; it may be that the latter are better than the former.
~~nor let some women scoff at other women; it may be that the latter are
~~better than the former. do not defame one another and do not call each
~~other by nicknames. how evil is the name of iniquity after faith. and
~~whoever does not repent, these are indeed transgressors. o you who
~~believe, avoid much suspicion. indeed some suspicion is sinful. and do
~~not spy on or backbite one another. would one of you like to eat the
~~flesh of his dead brother? you would hate it. and fear allah. verily,
~~allah is oft forgiving, most merciful. allah’s messenger (peace be upon
~~him) said: “if there are three of you, do not two of you talk secretly
~~to one another to the exclusion of the third until you mix with other
~~people, because you may hurt his feelings.” mental health: the rational
~~mind is the basis for accountability in islamic law. therefore, the wise
~~lawgiver commands that it should be preserved and protected and
~~prohibits everything that can diminish it or cause it harm. alcoholic
~~beverages and drugs are among the worst things that can cause the loss
~~of mental faculties. for this reason, allah has forbidden them, saying:
~~o you who believe, intoxicants, gambling, idols, and divination are
~~abominations of satan’s handiwork. PageV01P0033
# so avoid all of it so that perhaps you might be successful. satan
~~wants only to excite enmity and hatred between you with intoxicants and
~~gambling and hinder you from the remembrance of allah and from prayer.
~~so will you not then abstain? spiritual health: islamic law has taken
~~great care to set down ways to ensure and preserve spiritual health. it
~~encourages the believer to remember allah at all times. likewise it
~~makes a minimum amount of worship obligatory upon him to ensure that he
~~gets his spiritual nourishment. this includes the prescribed prayers,
~~fasting, zakâh tax, and the hajj pilgrimage. it then opens for him a
~~wide door for voluntary worship of every kind. these forms of worship
~~return the worshipper to his lord and reaffirm the bond that exist
~~between him and allah whenever the deluge of worldly concerns starts to
~~sweep him away. for this reason, allah’s messenger (peace be upon him)
~~would say: “the coolness of my eyes is prayer.” he also used to say to
~~bilâl, the one who would give the call to prayer: “o bilâl, let us find
~~relaxation in prayer.” islamic law prohibits everything that can cause
~~spiritual sickness and weakness. it prohibits us from following our vain
~~desires, clinging to baseless beliefs, and devotion to pleasure, because
~~these things blind the heart and make it heedless of allah’s
~~remembrance. for this reason, allah says, describing the unbelievers in
~~the following way: those who disbelieve will enjoy this world and eat as
~~cattle eat, and the hellfire will be their abode. PageV01P0034
# one should pursue the material provisions it has already been affirmed
~~in what preceded that islam does not deny the importance of material
~~causes for realizing happiness, except that these material things are
~~not a necessary condition for it; they are merely one of many means that
~~can work together to bring it about. many of the sacred ****s attest to
~~this fact. allah says: who has forbidden the adornment given by allah
~~that he has brought forth for his servants, and the good things of
~~sustenance? allah’s messenger (peace be upon him) said: “how good pure
~~wealth is for a pious servant.” he also said: “among the things that can
~~bring happiness to the son of adam are a pious wife, a good home, and a
~~good means of transport.” managing time time is a person’s capital,
~~being the duration of his stay on this world. islam, therefore, is very
~~concerned with time. it makes the believer responsible for the time at
~~his disposal. on the day of judgment, he will be asked about it. islamic
~~law requires that he manages his time wisely and utilizes it well. this
~~is achieved by balancing his worldly needs with his worship and caring
~~for his spiritual needs. islam encourages the believer to get maximum
~~benefit out of his time, filling it with beneficial activities and good
~~deeds. allah says: o you who believe, do not let your wealth and
~~children prevent you from the remembrance of allah. whosoever does this;
~~they are surely among the losers. PageV01P0035
# and spend from what we have provided you before one of you approaches
~~death and says, ‘my lord, if you would only give me a little more time,
~~i would give in charity and i would be one of the righteous. allah’s
~~messenger (peace be upon him) said: “the feet of a servant will not turn
~~away on the day of judgment until he is asked about four things: his
~~lifetime, how he lived it; his youth, how he spent it; his wealth, from
~~where he earned it and on what he spent it; and his work, what work did
~~he used to do.” allah’s messenger (peace be upon him) also said: “there
~~are two blessings that many people wish they had: health and free time.”
~~the prophet (peace be upon him) counseled us to balance our time,
~~saying: “give your hearts rest every hour, because if the heart is
~~forced, it becomes blind 3- الإسلام من الألف إلى الياء a-z of islam 3

~~is the complete submission and obedience to allah (god). the name allah
~~(god) in islam never refers to muhammad (pbuh), as many christians may
~~think; allah is the personal name of god. what do muslims believe about
~~allah? 1. he is the one god, who has no partner. 2. nothing is like him.
~~he is the creator, not created, nor a part of his creation. 3. he is
~~all-powerful, absolutely just. 4. there is no other entity in the entire
~~universe worthy of worship besides him. 5. he is first, last, and
~~everlasting; he was when nothing was, and will be when nothing else
~~remains. 6. he is the all-knowing, and all-merciful,the supreme, the
~~sovereign. 7. it is only he who is capable of granting life to anything.
~~8. he sent his messengers (peace be upon them) to guide all of mankind.
~~9. he sent muhammad (pbuh) as the last prophet and messenger for all
~~mankind. 10. his book is the holy qur'an, the only authentic revealed
~~book in the world that has been kept without change. 11. allah knows
~~what is in our hearts. these are some of the basic guidelines muslims
~~follow in their knowledge of god: 1. eliminate any anthropomorphism
~~(human qualities) from their conception of allah. his attributes are not
~~like human attributes, despite similar labels or appellations. 2.
~~PageV01P0037
# have unwavering faith in exactly what allah and prophet muhammad
~~(pbuh) described allah to be, no more, no less. 3. eradicate any hope or
~~desire of learning or knowing the modality of his names and attributes.
~~4. belief totally in all the names and attributes of allah; one cannot
~~believe in some and disbelieve the others. 5. one cannot accept the
~~names of allah without their associated attributes, i.e. one cannot say
~~he is al-hayy - 'the living' and then say that he is without life. 6.
~~similarity in names (or meanings) does not imply similarity in what is
~~being described (referents). as a robotics arm differs from a human arm,
~~so the "hand" of allah is nothing like a human hand, his speech is
~~nothing like human speech, etc. 7. certain words are ambiguous or vague
~~in their meanings, and thus may be susceptible to misinterpretation.
~~only those meanings that are in accordance with what is specified by
~~allah and his prophet (pbuh) are acceptable. cleanliness islam places
~~great emphasis on cleanliness, in both its physical and spiritual
~~aspects. on the physical side, islam requires the muslim to clean his
~~body, his clothes, his house, and the whole community, and he is
~~rewarded by god for doing so. prophet muhammad (pbuh) said, for example:
~~"removing any harm from the road is charity (that will be rewarded by
~~allah)." [bukhari] while people generally consider cleanliness a
~~desirable attribute, islam insists on it , making it an indispensable
~~fundamental of the faith. a muslim is required to to be pure morally and
~~spiritually as well as physically. PageV01P0038
# through the qur'an and sunnah islam requires the sincere believer to
~~sanitize and purify his entire way of life. in the qur'an allah commends
~~those who are accustomed to cleanliness: "allah loves those who turn to
~~him constantly and he loves those who keep themselves pure and clean."
~~[2: 22] in islam the arabic term for purity is taharah. books of islamic
~~jurisprudence often contain an entire chapter with taharah as a heading.
~~allah orders the believer to be tidy in appearance: "keep your clothes
~~clean." [74:4] the qur'an insists that the believer maintain a constant
~~state of purity: "believers! when you prepare for prayer wash your
~~faces, and your hands (and arms) to the elbows; rub your heads (with
~~water) and (wash) your feet up to the ankles. if you are ritually impure
~~bathe your whole body." [5: 6] ritual impurity refers to that resulting
~~from sexual release, menstruation and the first forty days after
~~childbirth. muslims also use water, not paper or anything else to after
~~eliminating body wastes. prophet muhammad )pbuh) advised the muslims to
~~appear neat and tidy in private and in public. once when returning home
~~from battle he advised his army: "you are soon going to meet your
~~brothers, so tidy your saddles and clothes. be distinguished in the eyes
~~of the people." [abu dawud] on another occasion he said: "don't ever
~~come with your hair and beard disheveled like a devil." [al-tirmidhi]
~~and on another: "had i not been afraid of overburdening my community, i
~~would have ordered them to brush their teeth for every prayer.
~~PageV01P0039
# " [bukhari] moral hygiene was not ignored, either, for the prophet
~~(pbuh) encouraged the muslims to make a special prayer upon seeing
~~themselves in the mirror: "allah, you have endowed me with a good form;
~~likewise bless me with an immaculate character and forbid my face from
~~touching the hellfire." [ahmad] and modesty in dress, for men as well as
~~for women, assists one in maintaining purity of thought. being
~~charitable is a way of purifying one's wealth. a muslim who does not
~~give charity (sadaqah) and pay the required annual zakah, the 2.5% alms-
~~tax, has in effect contaminated his wealth by hoarding that which
~~rightfully belongs to others: "of their wealth take alms so that you may
~~purify and sanctify them." [9: 103] all the laws and injunctions given
~~by allah and his prophet (pbuh) are pure; on the other hand, man-made
~~laws suffer from the impurities of human bias and other imperfections.
~~thus any formal law can only be truly just when it is purified by divine
~~guidance - as elucidated by the qur'an and the sunnah - or if it is
~~divinely ordained to begin with - the shari'ah. muslims contribution to
~~science astronomy muslims have always had a special interest in
~~astronomy. the moon and the sun are of vital importance in the daily
~~life of every muslim. by the moon, muslims determine the beginning and
~~the end of the months in their lunar calendar. by the sun the muslims
~~calculate the times for prayer and fasting. it is also by means of
~~astronomy that muslims can determine the precise direction of the
~~qiblah, to face the ka'bah in makkah, during prayer. PageV01P0040
# the most precise solar calendar, superior to the julian, is the
~~jilali, devised under the supervision of umar khayyam. the qur'an
~~contains many references to astronomy. "the heavens and the earth were
~~ordered rightly, and were made subservient to man, including the sun,
~~the moon, the stars, and day and night. every heavenly body moves in an
~~orbit assigned to it by god and never digresses, making the universe an
~~orderly cosmos whose life and existence, diminution and expansion, are
~~totally determined by the creator." [qur'an 30:22] these references, and
~~the injunctions to learn, inspired the early muslim scholars to study
~~the heavens. they integrated the earlier works of the indians, persians
~~and greeks into a new synthesis. ptolemy's almagest (the title as we
~~know it is arabic) was translated, studied and criticized. many new
~~stars were discovered, as we see in their arabic names - algol, deneb,
~~betelgeuse, rigel, aldebaran. astronomical tables were compiled, among
~~them the toledan tables, which were used by copernicus, tycho brahe and
~~kepler. also compiled were almanacs - another arabic term. other terms
~~from arabic are zenith, nadir, albedo, azimuth. muslim astronomers were
~~the first to establish observatories, like the one built at mugharah by
~~hulagu, the son of genghis khan, in persia, and they invented
~~instruments such as the quadrant and astrolabe, which led to advances
~~not only in astronomy but in oceanic navigation, contributing to the
~~european age of exploration. geography muslim scholars paid great
~~attention to geography. PageV01P0041
# in fact, the muslims' great concern for geography originated with
~~their religion. the qur'an encourages people to travel throughout the
~~earth to see god's signs and patterns everywhere. islam also requires
~~each muslim to have at least enough knowledge of geography to know the
~~direction of the qiblah (the position of the ka'bah in makkah) in order
~~to pray five times a day. muslims were also used to taking long journeys
~~to conduct trade as well as to make the hajj and spread their religion.
~~the far-flung islamic empire enabled scholar-explorers to compile large
~~amounts of geographical and climatic information from the atlantic to
~~the pacific. among the most famous names in the field of geography, even
~~in the west, are ibn khaldun and ibn batuta, renowned for their written
~~accounts of their extensive explorations. in 1166, al-idrisi, the well-
~~known muslim scholar who served the sicilian court, produced very
~~accurate maps, including a world map with all the continents and their
~~mountains, rivers and famous cities. al-muqdishi was the first
~~geographer to produce accurate maps in color. it was, moreover, with the
~~help of muslim navigators and their inventions that magellan was able to
~~traverse the cape of good hope, and da gama and columbus had muslim
~~navigators on board their ships. humanity seeking knowledge is
~~obligatory in islam for every muslim, man and woman. PageV01P0042
# the main sources of islam, the qur'an and the sunnah (prophet
~~muhammad's traditions), encourage muslims to seek knowledge and be
~~scholars, since this is the best way for people to know allah (god), to
~~appreciate his wondrous creations and be thankful for them. muslims were
~~therefore eager to seek knowledge, both religious and secular, and
~~within a few years of muhammad's mission, a great civilization sprang up
~~and flourished. the outcome is shown in the spread of islamic
~~universities; al-zaytunah in tunis, and al-azhar in cairo go back more
~~than 1,000 years and are the oldest existing universities in the world.
~~indeed, they were the models for the first european universities, such
~~as bologna, heidelberg, and the sorbonne. even the familiar academic cap
~~and gown originated at al-azhar university. muslims made great advances
~~in many different fields, such as geography, physics, chemistry,
~~mathematics, medicine, pharmacology, architecture, linguistics and
~~astronomy. algebra and the arabic numerals were introduced to the world
~~by muslim scholars. the astrolabe, the quadrant, and other navigational
~~devices and maps were developed by muslim scholars and played an
~~important role in world progress, most notably in europe's age of
~~exploration. muslim scholars studied the ancient civilations from greece
~~and rome to china and india. the works of aristotle, ptolemy, euclid and
~~others were translated into arabic. PageV01P0043
# muslim scholars and scientists then added their own creative ideas,
~~discoveries and inventions, and finally transmitted this new knowledge
~~to europe, leading directly to the renaissance. many scientific and
~~medical treatises, having been translated into latin, were standard ****
~~and reference books as late as the 17th and 18th centuries. mathematics
~~it is interesting to note that islam so strongly urges mankind to study
~~and explore the universe. for example, the holy qur'an states: "we
~~(allah) will show you (mankind) our signs/patterns in the
~~horizons/universe and in yourselves until you are convinced that the
~~revelation is the truth." [qur'an, 14:53] this invitation to explore and
~~search made muslims interested in astronomy, mathematics, chemistry, and
~~the other sciences, and they had a very clear and firm understanding of
~~the correspondences among geometry, mathematics, and astronomy. the
~~muslims invented the symbol for zero (the word "cipher" comes from
~~arabic sifr), and they organized the numbers into the decimal system -
~~base 10. additionally, they invented the symbol to express an unknown
~~quantity, i.e. variables like x. the first great muslim mathematician,
~~al-khawarizmi, invented the subject of algebra (al-jabr), which was
~~further developed by others, most notably umar khayyam. al-khawarizmi's
~~work, in latin translation, brought the arabic numerals along with the
~~mathematics to europe, through spain. the word "algorithm" is derived
~~from his name. PageV01P0044
# muslim mathematicians excelled also in geometry, as can be seen in
~~their graphic arts, and it was the great al-biruni (who excelled also in
~~the fields of natural history, even geology and mineralogy) who
~~established trigonometry as a distinct branch of mathematics. other
~~muslim mathematicians made significant progress in number theory.
~~medicine in islam, the human body is a source of appreciation, as it is
~~created by almighty allah (god). how it functions, how to keep it clean
~~and safe, how to prevent diseases from attacking it or cure those
~~diseases, have been important issues for muslims. prophet muhammad
~~himself urged people to "take medicines for your diseases", as people at
~~that time were reluctant to do so. he also said, "god created no
~~illness, but established for it a cure, except for old age. when the
~~antidote is applied, the patient will recover with the permission of
~~god." this was strong motivation to encourage muslim scientists to
~~explore, develop, and apply empirical laws. much attention was given to
~~medicine and public health care. the first hospital was built in baghdad
~~in 706 ac. the muslims also used camel caravans as mobile hospitals,
~~which moved from place to place. since the religion did not forbid it,
~~muslim scholars used human cadavers to study anatomy and physiology and
~~to help their students understand how the body functions. this empirical
~~study enabled surgery to develop very quickly. al-razi, known in the
~~west as rhazes, the famous physician and scientist, (d. 932) was one of
~~the greatest physicians in the world in the middle ages. PageV01P0045
# he stressed empirical observation and clinical medicine and was
~~unrivaled as a diagnostician. he also wrote a treatise on hygiene in
~~hospitals. khalaf abul-qasim al-zahrawi was a very famous surgeon in the
~~eleventh century, known in europe for his work, concessio (kitab al-
~~tasrif). ibn sina (d. 1037), better known to the west as avicenna, was
~~perhaps the greatest physician until the modern era. his famous book,
~~al-qanun fi al-tibb, remained a standard ****book even in europe, for
~~over 700 years. ibn sina's work is still studied and built upon in the
~~east. other significant contributions were made in pharmacology, such as
~~ibn sina's kitab al-shifa' (book of healing), and in public health.
~~every major city in the islamic world had a number of excellent
~~hospitals, some of them teaching hospitals, and many of them were
~~specialized for particular diseases, including mental and emotional. the
~~ottomans were particularly noted for their building of hospitals and for
~~the high level of hygiene practiced in them. definition the word islam
~~has a two-fold meaning: peace, and submission to god. this submission
~~requires a fully conscious and willing effort to submit to the one
~~almighty god. one must consciously and conscientiously give oneself to
~~the service of allah. this means to act on what allah enjoins all of us
~~to do (in the qur'an) and what his beloved prophet, muhammad (pbuh)
~~encouraged us to do in his sunnah (his lifestyle and sayings
~~personifying the qur'an). PageV01P0046
# once we humble ourselves, rid ourselves of our egoism and submit
~~totally to allah, and to him exclusively, in faith and in action, we
~~will surely feel peace in our hearts. establishing peace in our hearts
~~will bring about peace in our external conduct as well. islam is careful
~~to remind us that it not a religion to be paid mere lip service; rather
~~it is an all-encompassing way of life that must be practiced
~~continuously for it to be islam. the muslim must practice the five
~~pillars of the religion: the declaration of faith in the oneness of
~~allah and the prophet hood of muhammad (pbuh), prayer, fasting the month
~~of ramadan, alms-tax, and the pilgrimage to makkah; and believe in the
~~six articles of faith: belief in god, the holy books, the prophets, the
~~angels, the day of judgment and god's decree, whether for good or ill.
~~there are other injunctions and commandments which concern virtually all
~~facets of one's personal, family and civic life. these include such
~~matters as diet, clothing, personal hygiene, interpersonal relations,
~~business ethics, responsibilities towards parents, spouse and children,
~~marriage, divorce and inheritance, civil and criminal law, fighting in
~~defense of islam, relations with non-muslims, and so much more. human
~~rights islam has been from its inception very concerned with issues of
~~human rights. privacy, freedom, dignity and equality are guaranteed in
~~islam. the holy qur'an states clearly: "there is no compulsion in
~~religion. PageV01P0047
# " and there are no reliable reports to confirm the old accusations
~~that when the muslim armies were expanding into asia, africa and europe
~~the people were put to the sword if they failed to convert to islam. the
~~best proof is that not only did the christians, jews, zoroastrians and
~~hindus in those areas not perish or otherwise disappear, they actually
~~flourished as protected minority communities, and many individuals rose
~~to prominent positions in the arts, sciences, even in government. the
~~lives, property and privacy of all citizens in an islamic state are
~~considered sacred, whether or not the person is muslim. non-muslims have
~~freedom of worship and the practice of their religions, including their
~~own family law and religious courts. they are obliged to pay a different
~~tax (jizyah) instead of the zakah, and the state is obligated to provide
~~both protection and government services. before the modern era it was
~~extremely rare to find a state or government anywhere in the world that
~~was as solicitous of its minorities and their civil rights as the
~~islamic states. in no other religion did women receive such a degree of
~~legal and moral equality and personal respect. moreover, racism and
~~tribalism are incompatible with islam, for the qur'an speaks of human
~~equality in the following terms: "mankind! we created you from a single
~~soul, male and female, and made you into nations and tribes, that you
~~may come to know one another. truly, the most honored of you in god's
~~sight is the greatest of you in piety." jesus islam honors all the
~~prophets who were sent to mankind. PageV01P0048
# muslims respect all prophets in general, but jesus in particular,
~~because he was one of the prophets who foretold the coming of muhammad.
~~muslims, too, await the second coming of jesus. they consider him one of
~~the greatest of allah's prophets to mankind. a muslim does not refer to
~~him simply as "jesus," but normally adds the phrase "peace be upon him"
~~as a sign of respect. no other religion in the world respects and
~~dignifies jesus as islam does. the qur'an confirms his virgin birth (a
~~chapter of the qur'an is entitled "mary"), and mary is considered to
~~have been one of the purest women in all creation. the qur'an describes
~~jesus' birth as follows: "behold!' the angel said, god has chosen you,
~~and purified you, and chosen you above the women of all nations. mary,
~~god gives you good news of a word from him, whose name shall be the
~~messiah, jesus son of mary, honored in this world and in the hereafter,
~~and one of those brought near to god. he shall speak to the people from
~~his cradle and in maturity, and he shall be of the righteous. she said:
~~"my lord! how shall i have a son when no man has touched me?' he said:
~~"even so; god creates what he will. when he decrees a thing, he says to
~~it, 'be!' and it is." [3:42-47] muslims believe that jesus was born
~~immaculately, and through the same power which had brought eve to life
~~and adam into being without a father or a mother. "truly, the likeness
~~of jesus with god is as the likeness of adam. he created him of dust,
~~and then said to him, 'be!' and he was." [3:59] during his prophetic
~~mission, jesus performed many miracles. PageV01P0049
# the qur'an tells us that he said: "i have come to you with a sign from
~~your lord: i make for you out of clay, as it were, the figure of a bird,
~~and breathe into it and it becomes a bird by god's leave. and i heal the
~~blind, and the lepers, and i raise the dead by god's leave." [3:49]
~~muhammad and jesus, as well as the other prophets, were sent to confirm
~~the belief in one god. this is referred to in the qur'an where jesus is
~~reported as saying that he came: "to attest the law which was before me,
~~and to make lawful to you part of what was forbidden you; i have come to
~~you with a sign from your lord, so fear god and obey me." [3:50] prophet
~~muhammad emphasized the importance of jesus by saying: "whoever believes
~~there is no god but allah, alone without partner, that muhammad is his
~~messenger, that jesus is a servant and messenger of god, his word
~~breathed into mary and a spirit emanating from him, and that paradise
~~and hell are true, shall be received by god into heaven. [bukhari]
~~knowledge islam urges people to read and learn on every occasion. the
~~verses of the qur'an command, advise, warn, and encourage people to
~~observe the phenomena of nature, the succession of day and night, the
~~movements of stars, the sun, moon, and other heavenly bodies. muslims
~~are urged to look into everything in the universe, to travel,
~~investigate, explore and understand them, the better to appreciate and
~~be thankful for all the wonders and beauty of god's creations. the first
~~revelation to muhammad showed how much islam cares about knowledge.
~~"read, in the name of your lord, who created... PageV01P0050
# " [96:1] learning is obligatory for both men and women. moreover,
~~education is not restricted to religious issues; it includes all fields
~~of knowledge, including biology, physics, and technology. scholars have
~~the highest status in islam, second only to that accorded to prophets.
~~almost from the very beginnings of the islamic state muslims began to
~~study and to master a number of fields of so-called secular learning,
~~beginning with linguistics and architecture, but very quickly extending
~~to mathematics, physics, astronomy, geography, medicine, chemistry and
~~philosophy. they translated and synthesized the known works of the
~~ancient world, from greece, persia, india, even china. before long they
~~were criticizing, improving and expanding on that knowledge. centuries
~~before the european renaissance there were muslim ?rennaissance? men,
~~men who were simultaneously explorers, scientists, philosophers,
~~physicians and poets, like ibn sina (avicenna), umar khayyam, and
~~others. main pillars 1. shahadah the first pillar of islam is that a
~~muslim believe and declare his faith by saying the shahadah (lit.
~~'witness'), also known as the kalimah: la ilaha ila allah; muhammadur-
~~rasul allah. 'there is no god but allah; muhammad is the messenger of
~~allah.' this declaration contains two parts. the first part refers to
~~god almighty, the creator of everything, the lord of the worlds; the
~~second part refers to the messenger, muhammad (pbuh) a prophet and a
~~human being, who received the revelation through the archangel gabriel,
~~and taught it to mankind. PageV01P0051
# by sincerely uttering the shahadah the muslim acknowledges allah as
~~the sole creator of all, and the supreme authority over everything and
~~everyone in the universe. consequently the muslim closes his/her heart
~~and mind to loyalty, devotion and obedience to, trust in, reliance on,
~~and worship of anything or anyone other than allah. this rejection is
~~not confined merely to pagan gods and goddesses of wood and stone and
~~created by human hands and imaginations; this rejection must extend to
~~all other conceptions, superstitions, ideologies, ways of life, and
~~authority figures that claim supreme devotion, loyalty, trust, love,
~~obedience or worship. this entails, for example, the rejection of belief
~~in such common things as astrology, palm reading, good luck charms,
~~fortune-telling and psychic readings, in addition to praying at shrines
~~or graves of "saints", asking the dead souls to intercede for them with
~~allah. there are no intercessors in islam, nor any class of clergy as
~~such; a muslim prays directly and exclusively to allah. belief in the
~~prophet hood of muhammad (pbuh) entails belief in the guidance brought
~~by him and contained in his sunnah (traditions of his sayings and
~~actions), and demands of the muslim the intention to follow his guidance
~~faithfully. muhammad (pbuh) was also a human being, a man with feelings
~~and emotions, who ate, drank and slept, and was born and died, like
~~other men. he had a pure and upright nature, extraordinary
~~righteousness, and an unwavering faith in allah and commitment to islam,
~~but he was not divine. PageV01P0052
# muslims do not pray to him, not even as an intercessor, and muslims
~~abhor the terms "mohamedan" and "mohamedanism". 2. salah (prayer) prayer
~~(salah), in the sense of worship, is the second pillar of islam. prayer
~~is obligatory and must be performed five times a day. these five times
~~are dawn (fajr), immediately after noon (dhuhr), mid-afternoon ('asr),
~~sunset (maghrib), and early night (isha'). ritual cleanliness and
~~ablution are required before prayer, as are clean clothes and location,
~~and the removal of shoes. one may pray individually or communally, at
~~home, outside, virtually any clean place, as well as in a mosque, though
~~the latter is preferred. special is the friday noon prayer, called
~~jum'ah. it, too, is obligatory and is to be done in a mosque, in
~~congregation. it is accompanied by a sermon (khutbah), and it replaces
~~the normal dhuhr prayer. there is no hierarchical clerical authority in
~~islam, no priests or ministers. prayers are led by any learned person
~~who knows the qur'an and is chosen by the congregation. he (or she, if
~~the congregation is all women) is called the imam. there is also no
~~minimum number of congregates required to hold communal prayers. prayer
~~consists of verses from the qur'an and other prayers, accompanied by
~~various bodily postures - standing, bowing, prostrating and sitting.
~~they are said in arabic, the language of the revelation, though personal
~~supplications (du'ah) can be offered in one's own language. worshippers
~~face the qiblah, the direction of the ka'bah in the city of makkah.
~~PageV01P0053
# the significance of prayer lies in one's maintaining a continuous link
~~to god five times a day, which helps the worshipper avoid misdeeds if
~~he/she performs the prayers sincerely. in addition it promotes
~~discipline, god-consciousness and placing one's trust in allah alone,
~~and the importance of striving for the hereafter. when performed in
~~congregation it also provides a strong sense of community, equality and
~~brotherhood/sisterhood. 3. sawm (fasting) the fourth pillar of islam is
~~fasting. allah prescribes daily fasting for all able, adult muslims
~~during the whole of the month of ramadan, the ninth month of the lunar
~~calendar, beginning with the sighting of the new moon. exempted from the
~~fast are the very old and the insane. on the physical side, fasting is
~~from first light of dawn until sundown, abstaining from food, drink, and
~~sexual relations. on the moral, behavioral side, one must abstain from
~~lying, malicious gossip, quarreling and trivial nonsense. those who are
~~sick, elderly, or on a journey, and women who are menstruating,
~~pregnant, or nursing are permitted to break the fast, but must make up
~~an equal number of days later in the year. if physically unable to do
~~so, they must feed a needy person for each day missed. children begin to
~~fast (and to observe the prayers) from puberty, although many start
~~earlier. although fasting is beneficial to the health, it is regarded
~~principally as a method of self-purification. PageV01P0054
# by cutting oneself off from worldly pleasures and comforts, even for a
~~short time, the fasting person gains true sympathy for those who go
~~hungry regularly, and achieves growth in his spiritual life, learning
~~discipline, self-restraint, patience and flexibility. in addition to the
~~fast proper, one is encouraged to read the entire qur'an. in addition,
~~special prayers, called tarawih, are held in the mosque every night of
~~the month, during which a whole section of the qur'an (juz') is recited,
~~so that by the end of the month the entire qur'an has been completed.
~~these are done in remembrance of the fact that the revelation of the
~~qur'an to prophet muhammad (pbuh) was begun during ramadan. during the
~~last ten days - though the exact day is never known and may not even be
~~the same every year - occurs the night of power (laylat al-qadr). to
~~spend that night in worship is *****alent to a thousand months of
~~worship, i.e. allah's reward for it is very great. on the first day of
~~the following month, after another new moon has been sighted, a special
~~celebration is made, called 'id al-fitr. a quantity of staple food is
~~donated to the poor (zakat al-fitr), everyone has bathed and put on
~~their best, preferably new, clothes, and communal prayers are held in
~~the early morning, followed by feasting and visiting relatives and
~~friends. there are other fast days throughout the year. muslims are
~~encouraged to fast six days in shawwal, the month following ramadan,
~~mondays and thursdays, and the ninth and tenth, or tenth and eleventh of
~~muharram, the first month of the year. PageV01P0055
# the tenth day, called ashurah, is also a fast day for the jews (yom
~~kippur), and allah commanded the muslims to fast two days to distinguish
~~themselves from the people of the book. while fasting per se is
~~encouraged, constant fasting, as well as monasticism, celibacy, and
~~otherwise retreating from the real world, are condemned in islam.
~~fasting on the two festival days, 'id al-fitr and 'id al-adha, the feast
~~of the hajj, is strictly forbidden. 4. zakah the third pillar of islam
~~is the alms-tax (zakah). it is a tax on wealth, payable on various
~~categories of property, notably savings and investments, produce,
~~inventory of goods, salable crops and cattle, and precious ****ls, and
~~is to be used for the various categories of distribution specified by
~~islamic law. it is also an act of purification through sharing what one
~~has with others. the rationale behind this is that muslims believe that
~~everything belongs to god, and wealth is held by man as a trust. this
~~trust must be discharged, moreover, as instructed by god, as that
~~portion of our wealth legally belongs to other people and must be given
~~to them. if we refuse and hoard this wealth, it is considered impure and
~~unclean. if, for example one were to use that wealth for charity or to
~~finance one's pilgrimage to makkah, those acts would also be impure,
~~invalid, and of course unrewarded. allah says: "of their wealth, take
~~alms so you may purify and sanctify them." [9:103] the word zakah means
~~purification and growth. our possessions are purified by setting aside
~~that portion of it for those in need. PageV01P0056
# each muslim calculates his or her own zakah individually. for most
~~purposes this involves the payment each year of 2.5% of one's capital,
~~provided that this capital reaches a certain minimum amount that which
~~is not consumed by its owner. a generous person can pay more than this
~~amount, though it is treated and rewarded as voluntary charity
~~(sadaqah). this amount of money is provided to bridge the gap between
~~the rich and the poor, and can be used in many useful projects for the
~~welfare of the community. historically the pillar of zakah became
~~mandatory on muslims form the second year after the hijrah, 622 c.e. it
~~is mentioned more than thirty times in the qur'an, usually in the same
~~breath as salah. so important is this pillar that one is not considered
~~a part of the islamic brotherhood if one ignores this obligation. 5.
~~hajj the fifth pillar of islam is to make a pilgrimage (hajj) to makkah,
~~in saudi arabia, at least once in one's lifetime. this pillar is
~~obligatory for every muslim, male or female, provided that he/she is
~~physically and financially able to do so. prerequisites for performing
~~the hajj are to be a muslim, to be free, to be an adult or mature
~~enough, to be of sound mind, and to have the ability to afford the
~~journey and maintain one's dependents back home for the duration. the
~~reward for the hajj is nothing less than paradise. the hajj is the
~~ultimate form of worship, as it involves the spirit of all the other
~~rituals and demands of the believer great sacrifice. PageV01P0057
# on this unique occasion, nearly two million muslims from all over the
~~globe meet one another in a given year. regardless of the season,
~~pilgrims wear special clothes (ihram) - two, very simple, unsewn white
~~garments - which strips away all distinctions of wealth, status, class
~~and culture; all stand together and equal before allah (god). the rites
~~of hajj, which go back to the time of prophet abraham who built the
~~ka'bah, are observed over five or six days, beginning on the eighth day
~~of the last month of the year, named dhul-hijjah (pilgrimage). these
~~rites include circumambulating the ka'bah (tawwaf), and going between
~~the mountains of safa and marwah, as hajjar (abraham's wife) did during
~~her search for water for her son isma'il. then the pilgrims stand
~~together on the wide plain of arafah and join in prayers for god's
~~forgiveness, in what is often thought of as a preview of the last
~~judgment. the pilgrims also cast stones at a stone pillar which
~~represents satan. the pilgrimage ends with a festival, called 'id al-
~~adha, which is celebrated with prayers, the sacrifice of an animal, and
~~the exchange of greetings and gifts in muslim communities everywhere.
~~muhammad muhammad (pbuh) was an illiterate but wise and well-respected
~~man who was born in makkah in the year 570 c.e., at a time when
~~christianity was not yet fully established in europe. his first years
~~were marked by the deaths of his parents. since his father died before
~~his birth, his uncle, abu talib, from the respected tribe of quraysh,
~~raised him. PageV01P0058
# as muhammad (pbuh) grew up, he became known for his truthfulness,
~~generosity and sincerity, so that he was sought after for his ability to
~~arbitrate in disputes. his reputation and personal qualities also led to
~~his marriage, at the age of twenty-five, to khadijah, a widow whom he
~~had assisted in business. thenceforth, he became an important and
~~trusted citizen of makkah. historians describe him as calm and
~~meditative. muhammad (pbuh) never felt fully ******* to be part of a
~~society whose values he considered to be devoid of true religious
~~significance. it became his habit to retreat from time to time to the
~~cave of hira', to meditate near the summit of jabal al-nur, the
~~"mountain of light", near makkah. at the age of 40, while engaged in one
~~such meditative retreat, muhammad (pbuh) received his first revelation
~~from god through the angel gabriel. this revelation, which continued for
~~twenty-three years, is known as the qur'an, the faithful recording of
~~the entire revelation of god. the first revelation read: "recite: in the
~~name of your lord who created man from a clot (of blood). recite: your
~~lord is most noble, who taught by the pen, taught man what he did not
~~know." [96:1-5] it was this reality that he gradually and steadily came
~~to learn and believe, until he fully realized that it is the truth. his
~~first convert was khadijah, whose support and companionship provided
~~necessary reassurance and strength. he also won the support of some of
~~his relatives and friends. PageV01P0059
# three basic themes of the early message were the majesty of the one,
~~unique god, the futility of idol worship, the threat of judgment, and
~~the necessity of faith, compassion and morality in human affairs. all
~~these themes represented an attack on the crass materialism and idolatry
~~prevalent in makkah at the time. so when he began to proclaim the
~~message to others the makkans rejected him. he and his small group of
~~followers suffered bitter persecution, which grew so fierce that in the
~~year 622 c.e., god gave them the command to emigrate. this event, the
~~hijrah (migration), in which they left makkah for the city of madinah,
~~some 260 miles to the north, marked the beginning of a new era and thus
~~the beginning of the muslim calendar. during his suffering, muhammad
~~(pbuh) drew comfort from the knowledge revealed to him about other
~~prophets, such as abraham, joseph, and moses, each of whom had also been
~~persecuted and tested. after several years and some significant battles,
~~the prophet and his followers were able to return to makkah, where they
~~forgave their enemies and established islam definitively. by the time
~~the prophet died, at the age of 63, the greater part of arabia had
~~accepted islam, and within a century of his death, islam had spread as
~~far west as spain and as far east as china. it was clear that the
~~message was not limited to arabs; it was for the whole of humanity. the
~~prophet's sayings (hadith), are also believed to be revelation. the
~~number of sayings collected by his followers and scholars is about
~~10,000. PageV01P0060
# some typical examples of his sayings are as follows: "to pursue
~~knowledge is obligatory on every believing (man and woman)." [ibn majah]
~~"removing a harmful thing from the road is charity." [bukhari, muslim]
~~"those who do not show tenderness and love cannot expect to have
~~tenderness shown to them." [bukhari] "adore allah (god) as though you
~~see him; even if you do not see him, he nonetheless sees you." {bukhari,
~~muslim] although muhammad is deeply loved, revered and emulated by
~~muslims as god's final messenger, he is not an object of worship. women
~~at a time when the rest of the world, from greece and rome to india and
~~china, considered women as no better than children or even slaves, with
~~no rights whatsoever, islam acknowledged women's equality with men in a
~~great many respects. the qur'an states: "and among his signs is this:
~~that he created mates for you form yourselves that you may find rest,
~~peace of mind in them, and he ordained between you love and mercy. lo,
~~herein indeed are signs for people who reflect." [30:21] prophet
~~muhammad said: "the most perfect in faith amongst believers is he who is
~~best in manners and kindest to his wife." [abu dawud] muslims believe
~~that adam and eve were created from the same soul. both were equally
~~guilty of their sin and fall from grace, and both were forgiven by
~~allah. many women in islam have had high status; consider the fact that
~~the first person to convert to islam was khadijah, the wife of muhammad,
~~whom he both loved and respected. PageV01P0061
# his favorite wife after khadijah's death, aeisha, became renowned as a
~~scholar and one of the greatest sources of hadith literature. many of
~~the female companions accomplished great deeds and achieved fame, and
~~throughout islamic history there have been famous and influential
~~scholars, jurists and mystics. with regard to education, both women and
~~men have the same rights and obligations. this is clear in prophet
~~muhammad's saying: "seeking knowledge is mandatory for every believer."
~~[ibn majah] this implies men and women. a woman is to be treated as god
~~has endowed her, with rights, such as to be treated as an individual,
~~with the right to own and dispose of her own property and earnings,
~~enter into contracts, even after marriage. she has the right to be
~~educated and to work outside the home if she so chooses. she has the
~~right to inherit from her father, mother, and husband. a very
~~interesting point to note is that in islam, unlike any other religion, a
~~woman can be an imam, a leader of communal prayer, for a group of women.
~~a muslim woman also has obligations. all the laws and regulations
~~pertaining to prayer, fasting, charity, pilgrimage, doing good deeds,
~~etc., apply to women, albeit with minor differences having mainly to do
~~with female physiology. before marriage, a woman has the right to choose
~~her husband. islamic law is very strict regarding the necessity of
~~having the woman's consent for marriage. a marriage dowry (money) is
~~given by the groom to the bride for her own personal use. she keeps her
~~own family name, rather than taking her husband's. PageV01P0062
# as a wife, a woman has the right to be supported by her husband even
~~if she is already rich. she also has the right to seek divorce and
~~custody of young children. she does not return the dowry, except in a
~~few unusual situations. despite the fact that in many places and times
~~muslim communities have not always adhered to all or even many of the
~~foregoing in practice, the ideal has been there for 1400 years, while
~~virtually all other major civilizations did not begin to address these
~~issues or change their negative attitudes until the 19th and 20th
~~centuries, and there are still many contemporary civilizations which
~~have yet to do so. other religions islam is the religion of all
~~prophets. muslims believe that all the prophets were sent to their
~~respective peoples from god (allah). they all had the same mission and
~~message - guiding people to the right path. the three revealed,
~~monotheistic religions, islam, christianity, and judaism, go back to
~~abraham. the prophets of these religions were directly descended from
~~him - moses, jesus and others from isaac, but muhammad from isma?il. it
~~was prophet abraham who had established the settlement which today is
~~the city of makkah, and with his son isma?il built the ka?bah, which
~~muslims all over the world face when they pray. christians and jews hold
~~a special place in islam. they are called the people of the book (ahl
~~al-kitab), since the original torah and gospel were also divinely
~~revealed and they shared in the prophetic tradition. PageV01P0063
# islamic states have nearly always shown their religious minorities
~~tolerance and respect and those communities flourished under islamic
~~rule. god says: "...[t]hose who believe (in the message of islam), and
~~the jews, the sabaeans, and the christians - all those who believe in
~~allah and the last day, and act righteously - no fear shall come upon
~~them..." [5:69] setting up the islamic state in madinah, prophet
~~muhammad (pbuh) further warned: "whoever oppresses any dhimmi (non-
~~muslim citizen of the islamic state), i shall be his prosecutor on the
~~day of judgment." in setting up the islamic state, prophet muhammad made
~~it inclusive of the arabian jews and christians. their persons,
~~properties, churches and synagogues were protected, freedom of worship
~~was guaranteed, and they controlled their own community affairs with
~~their own civil and religious laws and courts. for most of the first
~~century of the islamic state, in fact, the majority of the citizens were
~~christians, enjoying peace and liberty such as they had not had even
~~under christian rome or byzantium. the jews, from the very beginning in
~~madinah, and later everywhere else, were lifted from the burden of being
~~clients of individual arab tribes to being citizens of the state, thus
~~freeing them to focus on their jewishness. when the islamic state
~~expanded outside arabia the jews of other lands were treated for the
~~first time as liberated citizens. judaism flourished as never before,
~~with jews even serving in muslim armies and administrations while their
~~culture bloomed in the arts, sciences, medicine and philosophy.
~~PageV01P0064
# this knowledge they transmitted to their brethren in the hostile
~~climate of christian europe. even jewish mysticism originated under the
~~influence of sufism and spread to northern europe. when islam reached
~~persia the concept of people of the book was extended to the
~~zoroastrians as well. later, when the muslims conquered parts of india
~~and encountered buddhists and hindus, who appeared to worship idols, the
~~question was referred to the ulema (council of scholars), who judged
~~that even they could have the same protected status as the jews and
~~christians, so long as they did not fight islam and they paid the jizyah
~~tax. peace "peace" is the most common word on a muslim's tongue.
~~whenever two people meet, they exchange greetings, wishing each other
~~peace: "peace be upon you." but peace cannot prevail except through
~~justice. since the concept of justice may differ from one man to
~~another, or from one society to another, muslims believe that real
~~justice is that which is specified by allah (god). islam permits
~~fighting in self-defense, in defense of the religion, or by those who
~~have been expelled forcibly from their homes. at the same time, islam
~~requires one to treat one's enemy mercifully. it lays down strict rules
~~of combat which include prohibitions against harming civilians and
~~against destroying crops, trees, and livestock. islam also requires that
~~if an enemy declares his desire to end hostilities and seek peace, the
~~muslims must do the same. the concept of jihad (struggling in the cause
~~of allah) is stated in the qur'an. PageV01P0065
# allah said: "fight in the cause of god those who fight you, but do not
~~transgress limits. god does not love transgressors." [2:19] jihad is
~~never to be waged to force anybody to choose a particular religion. on
~~the contrary, it is to waged to protect his right to choose freely.
~~therefore, if there is a force in the world that tries to prevent a
~~person from practicing this right, jihad may lead to fighting the force
~~that is trying to prevent him from exercising free will. relevance since
~~islam is the last religion revealed by allah, it possesses some elements
~~that make it unique. one of these is its relevance for human beings
~~regardless of place and time. this means that islam - submission to god
~~- is a comprehensive institution which includes all the guidelines
~~necessary for all aspects of life. therefore, the best way to understand
~~islam is to look at it as more than a religion - as a complete way of
~~life. in other words, it is a system which regulates every aspect of
~~life, dealing with all issues - social, economic, educational, judicial,
~~health, and even military. thus, it is suitable for all human beings and
~~for all times, since it is the final religion. islamic law aims to
~~achieve five goals for human beings in life: protecting the religion,
~~protecting one's self, protecting one's possessions, protecting one's
~~mind, and protecting one's offspring. therefore, god (allah) decided on
~~two main domains of law: 1. PageV01P0066
# if the domain always requires change and progress, allah legislated
~~comprehensive yet flexible rules and gave people the chance to create
~~and develop the necessary laws to satisfy the specific needs of a
~~certain period of time. for example, in the rule of consultation
~~(shura), allah decided that it should be the general rule for any
~~government; however, its form and style are left open for people to
~~choose and decide according to their needs. 2. if the domain does not
~~require or lend itself to change or progress, allah legislated fixed and
~~detailed laws that govern all issues related to a specific area. thus,
~~there is no way for man to change or develop those laws, which were made
~~for the welfare of all mankind. for example, the area of worshipping god
~~contains fixed details which cannot be changed at all. these regard
~~prayer, fasting, making pilgrimage, etc. another example is in family
~~matters, such as the laws of marriage, divorce, and inheritance. to show
~~how islam cares for the environment, one can cite the many laws that
~~protect the environment. about fourteen hundred years ago. prophet
~~muhammad (pbuh) said: "the world is green and beautiful, and allah has
~~appointed you as his stewards over it. he sees how you acquit
~~yourselves." muhammad showed how important plants and trees are by
~~saying: "whoever plants a tree and looks after it with care until it
~~matures and becomes productive will be rewarded in the hereafter." even
~~in the territory of an enemy, islam's care for plants, animals, and
~~trees is profound. PageV01P0067
# abu bakr, the first caliph, or successor, to muhammad (pbuh),
~~instructed his troops that he was sending into battle not to cut down
~~any trees or kill any animals except for food. these are but a few
~~examples of how islam remains relevant in the modern world. sources ?the
~~ultimate manifestation of god's grace for man, the ultimate wisdom, and
~~the ultimate beauty of expression: in short, the word of god.? this is
~~how the german scholar, muhammad asad, once described the qur'an. if one
~~were to ask any muslim to depict it, most likely they would offer
~~similar words. the qur'an, to the muslim, is the irrefutable, inimitable
~~word of god. it was revealed by god almighty, through the instrument of
~~prophet muhammad (pbuh). the prophet (pbuh) himself had no role in
~~authoring the qur'an, he was merely a human secretary, repeating the
~~dictates of the divine creator: "he (muhammad) does not speak of his own
~~desire. it is no less than an inspiration sent down to him." [53:3-4]
~~the qur'an was revealed in arabic, to prophet muhammad (pbuh), over a
~~period of twenty-three years. it is composed in a style so unique, that
~~it cannot be deemed either poetry or prose, but somehow a mixture of
~~both. the qur'an is imimitable; it cannot be simulated or copied, and
~~god almighty challenges mankind to pursue such an endeavor if he thinks
~~he can: "or do they say he forged it? say: bring then a chapter like
~~unto it, and call (to your aid) anyone you can, beside god, if it be you
~~speak the truth." [10:38]. PageV01P0068
# the qur'an's language is indeed sublime, its recitation moving, as one
~~non-muslim scholar noted, it was like ?the cadence of my heartbeat?. due
~~to its unique style of language, the qur'an is not only highly readable,
~~but also relatively easy to remember. this latter aspect has played an
~~important role not only in the qur'an's preservation, but in the
~~spiritual life of muslims as well. god himself declares, "and we have
~~indeed made the qur'an easy to understand and remember; then is there
~~anyone that will receive admonition?" [54:17] one of the most important
~~characteristics of the qur'an is that it remains today, the only holy
~~book which has never changed; it has remained free from any and all
~~adulterations. sir william muir noted, "there is probably in the world
~~no other book which has remained (fourteen) centuries with so pure a
~~****." the qur'an was written down during the lifetime and under the
~~supervision of the prophet, who himself was illiterate, and it was
~~canonized shortly after his death by a rigorous method which scrutinized
~~both written and oral traditions. thus its authenticity is unblemished,
~~and is its preservation is seen as the fulfillment of god's promise: "we
~~have, without doubt, sent down the message, and we will assuredly guard
~~it from corruption." [15:9] the qur'an is a book which provides the
~~human being the spiritual and intellectual nourishment he/she craves.
~~its major themes include the oneness of god, the purpose of human
~~existence, faith and god-consciousness, the hereafter and its
~~significance. PageV01P0069
# the qur'an also lays a heavy emphasis upon reason and understanding.
~~in these spheres of human understanding, the qur'an goes beyond just
~~satisfying the human intellect; it causes one to reflect on
~~implications. there are qur'anic challenges and prophecies. one of the
~~most exciting fields in recent years has been the discovery that, of the
~~significant amount of scientific information in the qur'an, including
~~the event of the big bang, embryological data, and other information
~~concerning astronomy biology, etc., there is not a single statement that
~~has not been borne out by modern discoveries in short, the qur'an
~~fulfills the heart, the soul, and the mind. perhaps the best de******ion
~~of the qur'an was given by ali, the cousin of prophet muhammad (pbuh)
~~when he expounded upon it as, "the book of god. in it is the record of
~~what was before you, the judgment of what is among you, and the
~~prophecies of what will come after you. it is decisive, not a case for
~~levity. whoever is a tryant and ignores the qur'an will be destroyed by
~~god. whoever seeks guidance from other than it will be misguided. the
~~qur'an is the unbreakable bond of connection with god; it is the
~~remembrance full of wisdom and the straight path. the qur'an does not
~~become distorted by tongues. nor can it be deviated by caprices; it
~~never dulls from repeated study; scholars will always want more of it.
~~the wonders of the qur'an are never ending. whoever speaks from it will
~~speak the truth, whoever rules with it will be just, and whoever holds
~~fast to it will be guided to the straight path. PageV01P0070
# " [al-tirmidhi] sunnah the term sunnah comes from the root word sanna,
~~which means to pave the way or make a path easily passable, such that it
~~becomes a commonly followed way by everyone afterwards. thus sunnah can
~~be used to describe a street or road or path on which people, animals,
~~and cars travel. additionally, it can apply to a prophetic way, i.e. the
~~law that they brought and taught as an explanation or further
~~clarification of a divinely revealed book. normally, the prophetic way
~~includes references to his sayings, actions, physical features and
~~character traits. from the islamic standpoint, sunnah refers to anything
~~narrated or related about the prophet muhammad (pbuh), authentically
~~traced to him regarding his speech, actions, traits, and silent
~~approvals, before and after the revelation. each narration is composed
~~of two parts: the isnad and the matn. the isnad refers to a chain of
~~people who narrated a paricular narration. the matn is the actual ****
~~of the narration. the isnad must comprise upright and sincere
~~individuals whose integrity is unquestionable. the speech of prophet
~~muhammad (pbuh) the speech of prophet muhammad (pbuh) refers to his
~~sayings. for example, he said: "actions are judged by their intentions;
~~everyone will be rewarded according to his/her intention. so whoever
~~migrates for the sake of allah and his prophet then his migration will
~~be noted as a migration for the sake of allah and his prophet.
~~conversely, one who migrates only to obtain something worldly or to
~~marry a woman, then his migration will be worth what he had inteded.?
~~[bukhari]. PageV01P0071
# the prophet (pbuh) also said: ?whoever believes in allah and the last
~~day, should say something good or keep quiet. the above two accounts
~~clearly show that the prophet (pbuh) spoke these words. consequently,
~~these are known as his speech. the actions of prophet muhammad (pbuh)
~~his actions pertain to anything he did, as authentically reported by the
~~sahabah (companions). for instance, hudhayfah reported that whenever the
~~prophet (pbuh) got up at night, he would clean his teeth with a tooth-
~~stick. also a'ishah reported that the prophet (pbuh) loved to do
~~everything starting with the right side - putting on shoes, walking,
~~cleaning himself, and in all his affairs generally. the silent approvals
~~of prophet muhammad (pbuh) his silent approvals on different issues
~~meant his not opposing or minding what he saw, heard or knew of the
~~actions or sayings of his companions. on one occasion, for example, the
~~prophet (pbuh) learned of actions of some of his companions from other
~~companions. soon after the battle of khandaq, prophet muhammad (pbuh)
~~gave the order to the companions to move quickly to surround the tribe
~~of banu quraydah, encouraging them to hurry so that perhaps they would
~~pray 'asr (the late afternoon prayer) there. some of the companions of
~~the prophet (pbuh) responded immediately and left without praying 'asr.
~~they arrived after sunset, pitched camp and prayed 'asr- after sunset.
~~at the same time another group of companions formulated their judgment
~~differently. PageV01P0072
# they thought that the prophet (pbuh) was merely encouraging them to
~~hasten to their destination, rather than to delay 'asr until after
~~sunset. consequently, they decided to stay in madinah until they had
~~prayed 'asr. immediately thereafter, they hastened towards the tribe of
~~banu quraydhah. when the prophet (pbuh) was told of how each group
~~responded differently to his announcement, he (pbuh) affirmed both
~~judgments. physical and moral traits of prophet muhammad (pbuh)
~~everything authentically narrated concerning the prophet's complexion
~~and the rest of his physical features is also included in the definition
~~of sunnah. umm ma'bad described what she saw of the great prophet
~~(pbuh). she said: "i saw a man, his face radiant with a bright glow, not
~~too thin or too fat, elegant and handsome. his eyes had a deep black hue
~~with long eyelashes. his voice was pleasant and his neck long. he had a
~~thick beard. his long black eyebrows were beautifully arched and
~~connected to each other. in silence, he remained dignified, commanding
~~utmost awe and respect. when he spoke, his speech was brilliant. of all
~~people he was the most handsome and the most pleasant, even when
~~approaching from a distance. in person, he was unique and most
~~admirable. graced with eloquent logic, his speech was moderate. his
~~logical arguments were well organized as though they were a string of
~~gems. he was not too tall or too short, but exactly in between. among
~~three, he appeared the most radiant and most vibrant. he had companions
~~who affectionately honored him. when he spoke, they listened to him
~~attentively. PageV01P0073
# when he gave orders, they were quick to execute them. they rallied
~~around him guarding him. he never frowned or spoke frivolously." [hakim]
~~along with his physical features, his companions also described his
~~habits and behavior with people. once anas reported: "i served the
~~prophet of allah (pbuh) for ten years. never once did he so much as
~~express any bit of displeasure nor did he ever ask 'why did you do it?'
~~for something i did or 'why didn't you do it?' for something i didn't
~~do." from the above we can clearly see that when the term sunnah appears
~~in a general con**** refering to prophet muhammad (pbuh) it comprises
~~anything narrated about the prophet (pbuh) and authentically traced to
~~him. once a muslim learns of the authenticity of any narration, he/she
~~is obliged to follow and obey it accordingly. such obedience is mandated
~~by allah as he declares "...and obey allah and his prophet and do not
~~turn away when you hear (him speak)." [8:20] at times, some muslims are
~~perplexed when people say that sunnah is something only recommended and
~~is not mandatory. thus they conclude that we are only required to follow
~~the qur'an and not the sunnah. such an argument results from a gross
~~misunderstanding. scholars of islamic jurisprudence use the term sunnah
~~to denote what is authentically established of prophet muhammad (pbuh)
~~in deeds which were not subsequently made mandatory by allah. they
~~further hold that this includes any saying of prophet muhammad (pbuh)
~~where he encourages muslims to do a particular task and compliments
~~those who imbibe such attributes. PageV01P0074
# thus to them, the term sunnah denotes what is authentically
~~established of prophet muhammad (pbuh) in deeds which he did voluntarily
~~and which were not subsequently made mandatory by allah. they further
~~hold that this includes any saying of prophet muhammad (pbuh) where he
~~encourages muslims to do a particular task and compliments those who
~~imbibe such attributes. thus to them, the term sunnah refers to what is
~~"recommended" and is not mandatory (fard or wajib). from the above, we
~~can clearly see that the term sunnah takes on different meanings when
~~used by different islamic disciplines. tolerance freedom of belief is
~~guaranteed in islam. it should be very clear that islam tolerates not
~~only other faiths but even its enemies. this is stated clearly in the
~~qur'an: "god forbids you not with regard to those who fight you not for
~~(your) faith, nor drive you out of your homes, from dealing kindly and
~~justly with them, for god loves those who are just." [60:8] it is one
~~function of islamic law to protect the privileged status of minorities,
~~and this is why non-muslim places of worship have flourished all over
~~the islamic world. islamic law also permits non-muslim minorities to set
~~up their own courts to implement family laws drawn up by the minorities
~~themselves and to govern their own affairs. history provides many
~~examples of muslim tolerance towards other faiths. when the great leader
~~and second caliph, umar, entered jerusalem in the year 634, islam
~~guaranteed freedom of worship to all religious communities in the city.
~~PageV01P0075
# in fact, so careful was umar in setting an example for his people that
~~he not only went to a church to pray, he prayed outside in the
~~courtyard, lest his followers after his death be tempted to convert the
~~church into a mosque. islam teaches that the closest to allah and the
~~most beloved of allah are those who are the best in piety. thus all
~~people, male and female, and regardless of race, color, nationality or
~~ethnicity, are considered and treated as equal before allah and before
~~the law. this concept of tolerance did not reach the west even in theory
~~until the 18th century, and in practice not until the 20th century.
~~universality in the qur'an, allah says: "we have sent you (muhammad) as
~~a mercy for all nations." [21:107] thus islam is not restricted to any
~~particular race or nation, as many other religions are, but is
~~universal, meaning that its message applies to all humanity, at all
~~times, in all places. since prophet muhammad (pbuh) was the last prophet
~~and messenger, his message applies to all future generations. all
~~previous prophets, from adam, noah and abraham to moses and jesus, were
~~also muslims: "not a single messenger did we send before you without
~~this inspiration sent by us to him that there is no god but i, therefore
~~worship and serve me." [21:25] since the qur'an is the final testament,
~~with every word and every letter unadulterated and unchanged, and
~~protected by allah from any change or tampering, it is the final
~~revelation, and no other law will ever supersede it. PageV01P0076
# it applies, moreover, to every aspect of one's daily life, including
~~personal, social, legal, economic, political, even military.
~~furthermore, islam affects every part of the individual - physical,
~~mental, emotional, and spiritual. 4- ماذا يعني الإسلام؟ 4- what does
~~islam mean? PageV01P0077
# what does islam mean? 1. islamic belief: islam is an arabic word, it
~~means that you totally surrender to god, and worship him only. here also
~~i must explain what does worship means? it doesn't mean that you only
~~pray, its meaning is much much wider, to worship god is that you look at
~~him as your only master, no other master controlling you, so he is the
~~only one you are loyal to , he is the only one you rely on, he is the
~~only one you fear, he is the only one who judges you and puts rules for
~~you, he is the axis your life rotates on, why? because he is our
~~creator, he is the creator of the universe and creator of everything, he
~~is the one who manages the universe, he is the strong, the compassionate
~~the merciful, he knows everything, he can do everything. he is the one
~~who controls the universe. how did we know that? god sent prophets to us
~~to teach us this and to tell us the laws he gave for us to go along our
~~life, we will be accounted on this in the hereafter. PageV01P0078
# don't think that the beginning of islam was only since muhammad (peace
~~be upon him), no that's wrong, islam began from the beginning of
~~creation, god created adam (peace be upon him) and adam was a muslim,
~~because he really worshipped god only, and began to have a family, all
~~the family were muslims,and the life went on, then people began to
~~deviate from this meaning and forgot god, began to worship idols, god
~~sent the prophets: noah, hud, saleh, abraham,moses, david, solomon,
~~jesus,muhammad and many other prophets (peace be upon them all), the
~~mission of all these prophets was to restore people back to the right
~~way of god, and to remind them of their reality. but at the end all
~~these prophets are not gods, they don't have any divine nature,because
~~allah is the only god,so when jews put very wrong concepts of god that
~~made him like a child they are deviating from concept of worshipping
~~god, because they are insulting him, and when christians say that jesus
~~is god or god's son, or that god is one in trinity, they are really
~~deviating from the concept , and when they make their priests invent
~~rules for them with no evidence from what god said or what his prophets
~~said, they also are deviating from the concept of worshipping god.
~~PageV01P0079
# we in islam refuse all these forms, if someone said that muhammad
~~(peace be upon him) is our god, he is a disbeliever, god is the only
~~god, if an immam said a fatwa, he must give his evidence on this fatwa,
~~he is not obeyed blindly, our standard is what allah and his prophet
~~told us (because the prophet is the one whom god sent not because he has
~~a divine nature because he hasn't). this is generally the islamic
~~belief. 2. islamic morals: god ordered us to be merciful, treat people
~~well, help people, he recommended us to treat our parents well, and to
~~keep always on helping them. 23. thy lord has commanded that ye worship
~~none but him, and that ye show kindness to parents. if one or both of
~~them attain old age with thee, never say to them as much as ugh nor
~~reproach them, but always address them with kindly speech. 24. and lower
~~them the wing of humility out of tenderness. and say, `my lord, have
~~mercy on them even as they nourished me when i was a little child.'
~~(holy quran 17:23-24) even if they were not muslims we must treat them
~~well but we don't obey them if they ordered us to disobey god. 15. and
~~if they contend with thee to make thee set up equals with me concerning
~~which thou hast no knowledge, obey them not, but be a kind companion to
~~them in worldly affairs, (holy quran 31:15) god ordered us to keep
~~always in contact with our relatives god said: 36. PageV01P0080
# and worship allah and associate naught with him, and show kindness to
~~parents, and to kindred (holy quran 4:36) also the prophet (peace be
~~upon him) said: “ he/she who believes in allah , the almighty and day of
~~judgment , must communicate , be good, courteous and kind to his kith
~~and kin or relatives.” (narrated by bukhari and muslim) also we are also
~~recommended to treat the neighbors well, even if they were not muslims
~~and even if they treated us badly as god said: and to the neighbour who
~~is a kinsman and the neighbour who is a stranger (holy quran 4:36)
~~prophet (peace be upon him) said: “(arch angel) gbriel , pbuh, pressed
~~on reminding me with the right of the neighbor until i thought he is
~~going to consider him an heir ( of mine) .” (narrated by bukhari and
~~muslim) he also says: “ the best of neighbor s in the sight of allah,
~~the almighty, is the one who is best to his neighbor”.(narrated by
~~tirmithee) god also told us to take care of orphans as in the same verse
~~and orphans there was a very severe punishment to those who take money
~~of orphans as god said: 10. surely they who devour the property of the
~~orphans unjustly, only swallow fire into their bellies, and they shall
~~burn in a blazing fire. (quran 4:10) god ordered us to be completely
~~fair with people even if i saw two people having a problem, one of them
~~is muslim, the other is non muslim, and i found the right with the non-
~~muslim, i must judge for the non-muslim. 135. PageV01P0081
# o ye who believe ! be strict in observing justice and be witnesses for
~~allah, even though it be against yourselves or against your parents or
~~kindred. whether he, against whom witness is borne, be rich or poor,
~~allah is more regardful of them both than you are. therefore follow not
~~your low desires that you may be able to act equitably. and if you hide
~~the truth or evade it, then know that allah is well-aware of what you
~~do. (quran 4:135) god ordered us also not to do adultery except with our
~~wives, because it is not a mess, and because it destroys the society and
~~makes people deviate and spoil, that's why god, ordered us to take all
~~the reasons to prevent this to happen, so he ordered women to wear hijab
~~which covers their body and heads so as not arise sexual desire in men,
~~and it is also a protection for the woman from being raped or being
~~annoyed by bad men. it makes women appear in a respectful way, their
~~body is not something public seen by all people, it is only for the one
~~she accepted as her husband. he ordered them when talking with men, not
~~to talk in a way that arises their sexual desire but to talk in a
~~serious way. 31. and say to the believing women that they restrain their
~~looks and guard their private parts, and that they display not their
~~beauty or their embellishment except that which is apparent thereof, and
~~that they draw their head-coverings over their bosoms (quran 24:31) so
~~be not soft in speech, lest he, in whose heart is a disease, should feel
~~tempted; and speak decent words. PageV01P0082
# (quran 33:32) as god ordered women to cover their body, he ordered men
~~not to look at women, because this arises their sexual desire, and may
~~lead them to adultery, or at least may lead them go astray from their
~~duties in this life. 30. say to the believing men that they restrain
~~their looks and guard their private parts. that is purer for them.
~~surely, allah is well-aware of what they do. (holy quran 24:30) this is
~~really one of the major problems the societies in the west face. god
~~ordered us not to lie or to promise with something and don't do, prophet
~~muhammad (peace be upon him) said that these are the properties of
~~hypocrites. 119. o ye who believe ! fear allah and be with the
~~truthful.(quran 9:119) and fulfill the covenant; for the covenant shall
~~be questioned about. 35. and give full measure when you measure and
~~weigh with a right balance; that is best and most commendable in the
~~end.(quran 17:34-35) 70. o ye who believe ! fear allah and say the
~~straightforward word. 71. he will set right you actions for you and
~~forgive you your sins. and whoso obeys allah and his messenger shall,
~~surely, attain a supreme triumph.( quran 33:70-71) god ordered us to say
~~good words and avoid bad words and emphasized much on this because the
~~slip of the tongue may cause many problems. 24. dost thou not see how
~~allah sets forth a parable of a good word ? it is like a good tree,
~~whose root is firm and whose branches reach into heaven ? 25. it brings
~~forth its fruit at all times by the command of its lord. and allah sets
~~forth parables for men that they may be reminded. 26. PageV01P0083
# and the case of an evil word, is like that of an evil tree, which is
~~uprooted from above the earth and has no stability. (quran 14:24-26) god
~~ordered us not to be arrogant but to be modest. 37. and walk not in the
~~earth haughtily, for thou canst not thus rend the earth, nor canst thou
~~reach the mountains in height. (quran 17:37) 63. and the true servants
~~of the gracious god are those who walk on the earth humbly and when the
~~ignorant address them, they avoid them gracefully by saying, `peace !'
~~(quran 25:63) finally god orders us to do everything good and avoid
~~everything bad. 90. verily, allah enjoins justice, and the doing of good
~~to others; and giving like kindred; and forbids indecency and manifest
~~evil and transgression. he admonishes you that you may take heed. (quran
~~16:90) 3. islamic pillars: they are five: 1. witnessing that allah is
~~the only god and that muhammad (peace be upon him) is his messenger: as
~~i explained in the beginning. 2. praying: we pray to god five times a
~~day in the mosques, from the benefits of praying: a. having
~~communication with god who created us b. meeting with muslims
~~periodically every day, connecting with each other, which strengthens
~~the islamic society. 3. zakat: every mature able muslim pays 2.5% of his
~~income to help in building islamic society, this is the minimum, god
~~promised us with high rewards for paying more and more. 276. allah will
~~blot out interest and will cause charity to increase. and allah loves
~~not anyone who is a confirmed disbeliever and an arch-sinner. (quran
~~2:276) 4. PageV01P0084
# fasting: every healthy mature able muslim must fast ramadan (one of
~~the islamic months), all muslims fast together in this month by stop
~~eating and drinking along the day, they begin fasting at the dawn, they
~~have breakfast at the sunset. this really builds the muslim character,
~~trains him to control his desire and his passion, besides when all
~~muslims fast together, this gives a beautiful picture of the muslims
~~being uniform, it also makes the rich feel the hunger and thrusts of
~~poor and motivates them to help the poor. 5. finally, the pilgrimage:
~~every healthy able muslim must do it once in his life. it is the annual
~~muslim conference where about 2 million muslims meet in mecca leaving
~~their countries being at rest their answering god's call, wearing simple
~~clothes, declaring their total obedience to god. the rites of the hajj
~~include circling the kaaba seven times and going seven times between the
~~hillocks of safa and marwa, as hagar did during her search for water.
~~then the pilgrims stand together in arafat and ask god for what they
~~wish and for his forgiveness, in what is often thought of as a preview
~~of the day of judgment. the end of the hajj is marked by a festival, eid
~~al-adha, which is celebrated with prayers. this, and eid al-fitr, a
~~feast-day commemorating the end of ramadan, are the two annual festivals
~~of the muslim calendar. 5- معنى الإسلام what is islam ? PageV01P0085
# what is islam ? the arabic term 'islam', meaning «submission», points
~~to the fundamental religious creed which dictates that a muslim submit
~~to the will of allah, conforming inwardly and outwardly to his laws. the
~~religion of islm lays great emphasis on uncompromising monotheism and
~~strict adherence to certain creeds and acts of worship. it enjoins
~~submitting to the will of allah and following the exemplary way of the
~~life of muhammad, the last of the prophets and messengers, may peace be
~~on them all. allah, the exalted created the universe and what is in it
~~that he be recognized as the one and only god. he created man and jinn
~~only to celebrate his praise and worship him. his words signify: "i have
~~only created jinns and men, that they may serve me"9. the ways and acts
~~of worship are not left to man's option or choice. allah is the one who
~~ordains and decrees all acts of worship and the means in which they must
~~be observed. since islam deals in every aspect of life, spiritual and
~~physical, its jurisprudence is based on creeds, acts of worship and
~~ordinances regarding social, economical and political transactions.
~~because islam is a perfect way of life, it enjoins maintaining a refined
~~code of manners. the messenger of 9. turban 51: 56. allah said:
~~''verily, i have been sent to accomplish the fine manners''. allah has
~~praised the fine manners of his messenger saying: "and surely thou hast
~~sublime morals''''. a'ishah. the wife of the messenger of allah, peace
~~be on him, was asked about his manners. she said: "his manners were al-
~~qur'an". PageV01P0086
# a'ishah meant that the prophet, peace be on him, clung to the qur'an,
~~it rules of discipline. its commands. its prohibitions, and the
~~excellent, beautiful and gracious things comprised in it. for this
~~reason allah commands the believers to follow the exemplary life of his
~~messenger, peace be on him. saying: ''ye have indeed in the messenger of
~~allah an excellent exempler''l'. i islam enjoins good manners for every
~~occasion. seeking permission, greeting, sitting, eating, learning,
~~teaching. sporting. travelling. dressing. visiting, sleeping, marriage,
~~treating people, particularly relatives and neighhours with kindness.
~~etc. codes of all such great manners are found in both the qur'an and
~~the prophetic traditions of the messenger of allah . peace he on him.
~~the family enjoys a high status in islam. it is the core of society; a
~~healthy family means a healthy society; hence allah, the exalted
~~commands to treat them with gentleness and submissiveness saying: "thy
~~lord hath decreed that ye worship none but him, and that ye he kind to
~~parents. 10. qur'an 68: 4. 11. qur'an 33: 21. whether one or both of
~~them attain old age in thy life, say not to them aword of contempt, nor
~~repel them but address them, in terms of honour. and, out of kindness,
~~lower to them the wing of humility, and say: 'my lord! bestow on them
~~thy mercy even as they cherished me in childhood''l2. next to family
~~comes the kindred. the messenger of allah, peace be on him, said that
~~allah has promised to he kind to him who behaves kindly to his kindred,
~~and to sever him who severs his kindred by unkind hehaviour .
~~PageV01P0087
# 12. qur'an 17: 23, 24. 6- لماذا يجب أن تختار الإسلام؟ 6- why islam?
~~the question "why?" demands a rational answer why islam? the question
~~"why?" demands a rational answer it is true that one cannot have an
~~adequate mental picture of some mathematical and scientific facts. for
~~example, one cannot have an adequate mental or visual picture of the
~~curvature of space, or one of the mathematical concepts of infinity. nor
~~can we really have an adequate mental picture of the way in which
~~certain animals experience things, such as the way in which bats 'see'
~~by using ultrasonic waves. however, know these concepts to be true
~~because of solid evidence and not because of some non-rational ideas.
~~therefore we can say that we do indeed comprehend them. now what about
~~the concept of a singular, all-knowing entity which has created the
~~universe. it is impossible to have any mental or visual picture of such
~~an entity, for evidence tells us that this entity must be unlike
~~anything in the universe because this entity must be independent of
~~space and time. the evidence for the existence of this single
~~intelligence lies in the design of nature itself, which we can freely
~~examine; hence, such an ideology is rational. if one realizes this -
~~through confirmation - then one can proceed to answer the question: why
~~islam? one of the main problems with an atheistic ideology is that it
~~cannot explain intelligence in the processes of the universe. another
~~problem is that it tends to deprive life of meaning. PageV01P0088
# furthermore, we know that human beings are naturally inclined to be
~~honest; however, in atheism there is a denial of an ultimate originator
~~and of anything beyond death, which creates a contradiction and leads to
~~an inconsistency in behaviour – on the one hand a person would be
~~inclined to be honest, and on the other to be dishonest 'to make the
~~most of this world'. [if everyone insisted on 'making the most of this
~~world', society as we know it would not exist. as a case in point, let
~~us suppose that all those who wanted to 'make the most of this world'
~~resorted to thievery. if this happened, no one would be producing the
~~goods (growing food for instance) that the rest of us could steal. hence
~~it seems that 'making the most of this world' as system of action is
~~doomed to failure. could it then be a viable system of belief?] broadly
~~speaking, with regard to theistic ideologies we have the revealed, the
~~distorted and the man-made. one can easily say that a way of life
~~communicated to humankind by the creator of this universe is preferred
~~to man-made ideologies. if one wants to follow the advice of that which
~~has made the universe and all that it contains - regarding what is
~~beneficial or harmful - then it is better to refer to pristine
~~communication from this originator, than to that communication which has
~~been fabricated or distorted by man. those ideologies claiming to be
~~based on revelations can be subjected to a number of tests, the first
~~and most important of which is that of consistency. we must look for two
~~types of consistency: internal and external. PageV01P0089
# internal consistency means that a statement made in a book must not
~~contradict another statement in the same book. external consistency
~~means that a statement made in a book must not contradict facts as we
~~know, be they psychological, physical, chemical, historical,
~~geographical, biological and so on. applying these tests, consider the
~~most important truth that all the supposedly revealed ideologies
~~proclaim, that is, the existence and perfect attributes of god. god for
~~all ideologies, that claim to be revealed, is supposed to be all
~~knowing, all merciful, everlasting etc. however, some books imply that
~~god's knowledge is limited and imperfect by saying that, for example,
~~god was deceived by a human. in contrast, the quran provides the perfect
~~concept of an all-knowing, singular originator of this universe. this
~~leads us to the next test - that of authenticity. the question that
~~should be asked is whether the ******ures that we have today are indeed
~~a communication from the originator to humankind. a study of the history
~~of islam would show that the present quran is exactly the same as that
~~which was communicated about one thousand four hundred years ago. during
~~its revelation it was committed to memory by a large number of people
~~and also written down. yet another test is that of comprehensiveness. a
~~truly comprehensive ideology, revealed to humankind by the designer of
~~the universe, would describe the most beneficial system in all spheres
~~of life including the political, economical, social, medical and
~~environmental spheres. PageV01P0090
# lastly, we might look at the test of universality. clearly, an
~~ideology which is historically or graphically bound is not as good as
~~that which applicable to all human beings, irrespective of the time and
~~place of their origin. in conclusion, if one uses the criteria of
~~universality, comprehensiveness, authenticity and above all,
~~consistency, one would find the quran unique and worthy of
~~investigation. it is interesting to note that the quran itself stresses
~~the above-mentioned approach. for example, in verse 82 of chapter 4, it
~~is said, "will they not ponder about the quran? if it had been from
~~other than god, then they would have surely found in it many
~~inconsistencies." 7- لماذا الإسلام؟ ولمن؟ وأين؟ 7- islam ..why? ..for

# " { al- qur'an 22:34 8- اهتمام الإسلام بالجسد والعقل والروح 8- body,
~~spirit, mind, heart, and conscience body, spirit, mind, heart, and
~~conscience the multi-dimensional nature that man has been blessed with
~~highlights the essence of his creation, his role, and his destiny.
~~rather than stressing on the body or the soul in isolation, islam
~~endorses a view in which the body, the spirit, the mind, the heart, and
~~the conscience of man are all highlighted. islam does not endorse a
~~worldview in which the physical body is seen as something “profane” and
~~vulgar and necessarily completely independent from the purity of the
~~spirit. just as the spirit can be purified, the purification of the body
~~is also an important part of everyday life. islam also respects both the
~~mind and the conscience of man. many verses in the qur’an stress the
~~importance of using the mind when it says what means ?certainly we have
~~revealed to you a book in which is your good remembrance; what! do you
~~not then understand?? (al-anbiyaa’ 21:10) also it says what means ?it is
~~he who gives life and death, and to him [is due] the alternation of
~~night and day: will ye not then understand?? (al-mu’minun 23:80) and
~~again ?will they not then ponder on the qur’an? if it had been from
~~other than god they would have found therein much incongruity.? (an-
~~nisaa’ 4:82) pondering, understanding, thinking, are all encouraged. it
~~is man’s conscience that leads him to repent sincerely when he has
~~sinned, thereby paving the way for god’s guaranteed forgiveness.
~~PageV01P0093
# all of these aspects are not taken separately, but are seen as working
~~in a mutually interdependent harmony, each supporting the other towards
~~the goal of achieving inner peace and ******* in this life and the next.
~~therefore, man is not seen as a single-faceted entity, but rather as a
~~multi-dimensional, honored being with a purpose in life and a goal to
~~achieve. he is considered holistically, rather than partially. he is
~~endowed with the abilities and traits that can help him both achieve his
~~mission here on earth and elevate himself through a close relationship

~~embrace islam? ‘part one’ PageV01P0094
# how and why do people embrace islam? ‘part one’ people embrace islam
~~in the west (usa, canada, uk, france and germany), in the middle eastern
~~countries (saudi arabia, the gulf states, jordan), in africa and the far
~~east (malaysia, philippines, hong kong) and many other countries all
~~over the world. according to islam, there is only one revealed religion
~~which has been revealed from the time of adam until the last of the
~~prophets, mohammad (pbuh), yet it was revealed on stages. consequently,
~~the essential message of all the prophets was one and the same, allah
~~says in the holy qur’an: “verily, we have sent to every nation a
~~messenger (saying), ‘worship allah and avoid false gods.” all the
~~prophets that allah has sent had one basic messages, for indeed the
~~purpose of creation is only one, which is worshiping allah. allah says
~~in the holy qur’an “i did not create the jinn and mankind except for my
~~worship.” this message addressed a basic and essential need in human
~~beings; the need to worship. such basic need was created in all human
~~beings at the time of adam’s creation. man’s natural disposition : the
~~fitrah as allah made all human beings swear to his godhood when he first
~~created adam, this oath is printed on the human soul even before it
~~enters the fetus in the fifth month of pregnancy. so when a child is
~~born, he has a natural belief in allah. this natural belief is called in
~~arabic the fitrah. if the child was left alone, he would grow with the
~~same faith and believe in allah. PageV01P0095
# but what happens is that all children get affected by their
~~surroundings, whether directly or indirectly. prophet mohammad (pbuh)
~~said that allah said: “i created my servants in the right religion but
~~the devils made them go astray.” prophet mohammad (pbuh) also said:
~~“each child is born in a state of ‘fitrah’, but his parents make him a
~~jew or a christian. it is like the way an animal gives birth to a normal
~~offspring. have you noticed any (young animal) born mutilated before you
~~mutilate them?” and since the child’s body submits to the physical laws
~~which allah has put in nature, his soul also submits naturally to the
~~belief that allah is its lord and creator. however, his family friends,
~~and his surroundings affect him, and as he grows up, he may find himself
~~following this or that’s way of life. the religion the child follows at
~~early stages of his life (childhood) is one of custom and upbringing,
~~and allah does not punish him for this religion. however, by reaching
~~maturity one starts differentiating between what’s right and what’s
~~wrong, an adult must now follow the religion of knowledge and reason;
~~islam. at this point the devil starts doing his best and trying hard to
~~encourage him to stay as he is ( encourage him to stay passive and not
~~do any good deeds), or bring down. evils are made pleasing to mankind
~~and thus we live in a constant struggle between our fitrah and our
~~desires till we find the right road. PageV01P0096
# if one chooses his fitrah, allah will help him control his desires,
~~even though it may take most of his life to do so; for example some
~~people embraced islam in their old age, yet it is never too late. 11-

~~embrace islam? ‘part two’ PageV01P0097
# how and why do people embrace islam? ‘part two’ people embrace islam
~~in the west (usa, canada, uk, france and germany), in the middle eastern
~~countries (saudi arabia, the gulf states, jordan), in africa and the far
~~east (malaysia, philippines, hong kong) and many other countries all
~~over the world. people in all ages may be divided into two main groups
~~with respect to their preparedness to receive the message: 1. those
~~searching for the truth who are dissatisfied with the religion followed
~~by their contemporaries on one hand, 2. and those not searching. this
~~second group may be further divided into those not searching because
~~they are satisfied with their religion and those not searching because
~~they have rejected belief in god. the second group has been a minority
~~throughout history. people usually tend to accept the cultural norms of
~~their society without question. in prophet mohammad’s time, that
~~minority was called the hunafaa’ . most of them embraced islam once they
~~received the message. very few however, due to tribal jealousies
~~rejected the islam message. thus, the first group responded positively
~~to the clear truth of revelation. on the other hand, the second group
~~based their response on their trust in prophet mohammad’s (pbuh)
~~character. for he was indeed truthful and honest throughout his life,
~~therefore, there was not reason to doubt him being a prophet. 1.
~~PageV01P0098
# the role model first people who embraced islam were from the prophet’s
~~(pbuh) household khadijah bint khuwaylid ‘ali ibn abi talib zayd ibn
~~harithah afterwards the prophet’s close friend and confidant joined them
~~and embraced islam too. their embracing islam was partially a result of
~~their direct contact with the prophet (pbuh) and their unquestioned
~~belief in him and his truthfulness due to their personal experience with
~~him. this reason for conversion may be called the “role model.” 2.
~~da’wah to islamic monotheism (tawheed) the next five figured embraced
~~islam with the help of abu bakr’s invitation. ‘uthman ibn ‘affan az-
~~zubayr ibn al- ‘awwam ‘abdur-rahmaan ibn ‘awf sa ‘ad ibn abi waqqas
~~talhah ibn ‘ubaydullah in their case, embracing islam was a result of
~~them to introducing the message of islam and calling them to embrace it.
~~here the reason may be generally called the “da’wah”( calling for islam)
~~3. truth seekers among the converts was ‘amr ibn ‘absah who had rejected
~~the idolatry of his people and went on his search for the truth. same
~~case was with salman al-farisi who journeyed from zoroastrianism,
~~judaism, christianity to islam. the reason for the conversion of those
~~companions of the prophet (pbuh) and others like them may be called
~~“truth seekers”. 4. reading the qur’an ‘umar ibn al-khattab’s embracing
~~islam was as a result of his hearing the prophet (pbuh) recite surrah
~~al-haaqqah. the najashi’s was due to his hearing surrah maryam. these
~~and others like them may be referred to as those who embraced islam as a
~~result if “reading the qur’an”. 5. PageV01P0099
# moreover islam reached out to the far east countries through muslim
~~businessmen and salesmen who went there for business, their ethics in
~~business dealings and their honesty encouraged people to embrace islam,
~~and so we have lots of muslims at these countries, like thailand. so
~~islam wasn't spread with the power of sword, as some anti-muslims claim.
~~it was through presenting the true image and nature of this fine
~~religion that made people want to embrace islam. different reasons
~~behind embracing islam were almost the same in all ages. they are not
~~limited to time periods, but can be found from the earliest of times
~~until the present. those involved in propagating the religion and
~~inviting others to islam, must familiarize themselves with these and
~~other factors in order to develop the correct strategies to deal with
~~them. the other major problem that muslims face, especially in western
~~societies, is the absence of a muslim community to support their
~~families, their children often leave islam by the time they graduate
~~from high school. consequently, among the da’wah strategies necessary is
~~the development of muslim schools to preserve the identity of muslim
~~children of the converts. سماحة الاسلام tolerance in islam PageV01P0100
# tolerance in islam in spain under the umayyads and in baghdad under
~~the abbasid khalifas, christians and jews, equally with muslims, were
~~admitted to the schools and universities - not only that, but were
~~boarded and lodged in hostels at the cost of the state. when the moors
~~were driven out of spain, the christian conquerors held a terrific
~~persecution of the jews. those who were fortunate enough to escape fled,
~~some of them to morocco and many hundreds to the turkish empire, where
~~their descendants still live in separate communities, and still speak
~~among themselves an antiquated form of spanish. the muslim empire was a
~~refuge for all those who fled from persecution by the inquisition. the
~~western christians, till the arrival of the encyclopaedists in the
~~eighteenth century, did not know and did not care to know, what the
~~muslim believed, nor did the western christian seek to know the views of
~~eastern christians with regard to them. the christian church was already
~~split in two, and in the end, it came to such a pass that the eastern
~~christians, as gibbon shows, preferred muslim rule, which allowed them
~~to practice their own form of religion and adhere to their peculiar
~~dogmas, to the rule of fellow christians who would have made them roman
~~catholics or wiped them out. for the muslims, judaism, christianity and
~~islam are but three forms of one religion, which, in its original
~~purity, was the religion of abraham: al-islam, that perfect self-
~~surrender to the will of god, which is the basis of theocracy.
~~PageV01P0101
# the jews, in their religion, after moses, limited god's mercy to their
~~chosen nation and thought of his kingdom as the dominion of their race.
~~even christ himself, as several of his sayings show, declared that he
~~was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of israel and seemed to
~~regard his mission as to the hebrews only; and it was only after a
~~special vision vouchsafed to st. peter that his followers in after days
~~considered themselves authorized to preach the gospel to the gentiles.
~~the christians limited god’s mercy to those who believed certain dogmas.
~~every one who failed to hold the dogmas was an outcast or a miscreant,
~~to be persecuted for his or her soul’s good. in islam only is manifest
~~the real nature of the kingdom of god. the two verses (2:255-256) of the
~~qur’an are supplementary. where there is that realization of the majesty
~~and dominion of allah (swt), there is no compulsion in religion. men
~~choose their path - allegiance or opposition - and it is sufficient
~~punishment for those who oppose that they draw further and further away
~~from the light of truth. in egypt the copts were on terms of closest
~~friendship with the muslims in the first centuries of the muslim
~~conquest, and they are on terms at closest friendship with the muslims
~~at the present day. in syria the various christian communities lived on
~~terms of closest friendship with the muslims in the first centuries of
~~the muslim conquest, and they are on terms of closest friendship with

~~terrorism. one of the first interesting things i learned in the koran
~~was that the name of the faith comes from the word salam - peace. far
~~from the kind of turko-arab-centric message i expected, the koran
~~presented a belief in the universal existence of god, one god for all.
~~it does not discriminate against peoples; it says we may be different
~~colors and from different tribes, but we are all human and "the best of
~~people are the most god- conscious". today, as a muslim, i have been
~~shattered by the horror of recent events; the display of death and
~~indiscriminate killing we've all witnessed has dented humanity's
~~confidence in itself. PageV01P0104
# terror on this scale affects everybody on this small planet, and no
~~one is free from the fallout. yet we should remember that such violence
~~is almost an everyday occurrence in some muslim lands: it should not be
~~exacerbated by revenge attacks on more innocent families and
~~communities. along with most muslims, i feel it a duty to make clear
~~that such orchestrated acts of incomprehensible carnage have nothing to
~~do with the beliefs of most muslims. the koran specifically declares:
~~"if anyone murders an (innocent) person, it will be as if he has
~~murdered the whole of humanity. and if anyone saves a person it will be
~~as if he has saved the whole of humanity." the koran that our young
~~people learn is full of stories and lessons from the history of humanity
~~as a whole. the gospels and the torah are referred to; jesus and abraham
~~are mentioned. in fact there is more mention in the koran of the prophet
~~moses than of any other. it acknowledges the coexistence of other
~~faiths, and in doing so acknowledges that other cultures can live
~~together in peace. "there is no compulsion in religion," it states,
~~meaning that people should not be compelled to change their faith.
~~elsewhere it states, "to you, your religion; to me mine." respect for
~~religious values and justice is at the koran's core. the koranic history
~~we teach our young provides ample examples of inter-religious and
~~international relationships; of how to live together. but some
~~extremists take elements of the sacred ******ures out of con****.
~~PageV01P0105
# they act as individuals, and when they can't come together as part of
~~a political structure or consultative process, you find these dissident
~~factions creating their own rules, contrary to the spirit of the koran -
~~which demands that those recognized as being in charge of muslims must
~~consult together regarding society's affairs. there is a whole chapter
~~in the koran entitled consultation. communal well being is central to
~~human life, so there is a concept in islam called istihsan, which means
~~"to look for the common good". even though the koran may lay down a
~~diktat, scholars are also supposed to consider the circumstances
~~prevalent at the time. sometimes that means choosing the lesser of two
~~evils or even suspending legislation if necessary: for instance, a
~~person who steals bread during a famine is not treated as a thief. once
~~i wrote in a song, "where do the children play?" our sympathy and
~~thoughts go out to the families of all those who lost their lives in
~~this tragic act of violence, as well as all those injured. but life must
~~go on. children still need to play, and people need to live and learn
~~more about their neighbors so that ignorance doesn't breed more blind
~~fanaticism. moderation is part of faith, so those who accuse muslim
~~schools of fostering fanaticism should learn a bit more about islam. the
~~prophet (peace be upon him) said, "ruined are those who insist on
~~hardship in faith," and, "a believer remains within the scope of his
~~religion as long as he doesn't kill another person illegally.
~~PageV01P0106
# " such knowledge and words of guidance are desperately needed at this
~~time, to separate fact from falsehood, and to recognise the last
~~prophet's own definition of that which makes a person representative, or
~~otherwise, of the faith he lived and the one we try to teach. by yusuf

~~users rated this article 3.82 out of 5 most popular question: what is
~~obligatory upon a muslim with respect to non-muslims concerning
~~different types of interactions and also with respect to holidays and
~~festivals? response: the responsibility of a muslim towards non-muslims
~~are many, including: first, he must call them to the way of allah. this
~~is to preach to them and to make clear to them the reality of islam,
~~according to his ability and if he has the knowledge to do so. this is
~~the greatest and best good deed that one could do toward his fellow
~~citizen and for those who live together with jews, christians and other
~~disbelievers. on this point, the prophet (peace be upon him) said, "the
~~one who guides to good gets the same reward as the one who performs it."
~~[muslim] the prophet (peace be upon him) also told ali, when he was
~~sending him to khaibar to encounter the jews, to invite the jews to
~~islam. he told him, "by allah, if allah guides one person by you, it is
~~better for you than the best types of camels." [al-bukhaaree, muslim]
~~the prophet (peace be upon him) also said, "whoever calls to guidance
~~will have a reward similar to the reward of the one who follows him,
~~without the reward of either of them being lessened at all. PageV01P0108
# " [muslim, ahmad, aboo daawood, an-nasaa'ee, at-tirmidhee, ibn maajah]
~~calling them to islam, preaching islam to them and advising them
~~concerning that is one of the most important deeds and is one of the
~~best ways to get closer to allah. second, [the muslim] may not wrong the
~~other person with respect to his life, wealth or honor, if the non-
~~muslim is a citizen of the islamic state or has attained other
~~protection. he must fulfill the other's rights. he may not wrong him
~~with respect to his wealth by stealing from him, deceiving him or
~~cheating him. he cannot harm him in his body by beating or killing him.
~~his protection from the state guarantees his safety from such things.
~~third, there is no prohibition concerning buying, selling, renting or
~~other such business transactions with them. it has been authentically
~~reported that the prophet (peace be upon him) bought things from the
~~polytheistic disbelievers. he also purchased items from jews. in fact,
~~when the prophet (peace be upon him) died, his shield was being held as
~~collateral with a jewish person in exchange for food for his family.
~~fourth, he must be neighborly toward his non-muslim neighbor. if your
~~neighbor is good to you, you do not harm him and you may even give him
~~charity if he is poor or give him a gift if he is rich. you may also
~~advise him concerning what is good for him. and because neighbors have
~~very great rights. the prophet (peace be upon him) said, "the angel
~~gabriel kept advising me concerning the neighbor until i thought he was
~~going to inherit [from his neighbor]. PageV01P0109
# " [al-bukhaaree, muslim] allah also says in the quran, "allah does not
~~forbid you to deal justly and kindly with those who fought not against
~~you on account of religion and drove you not from your homes. verily,
~~allah loves those who deal with equity" [al-mumtahinah (60):7]. it is
~~recorded in an authentic hadith from asma bint abu bakr that her mother,
~~who was a polytheist, visited her and asked for her assistance - this
~~was during the time of the peace treaty between the prophet (peace be
~~upon him) and the disbelievers so she went to the prophet (peace be upon
~~him) to ask him about that and he told her to keep the ties of kinship
~~with her and be righteous towards her. fifth, a muslim should not
~~participate with them in their greetings and festivals. however, one may
~~give them condolences upon the death of someone if he finds some legal
~~benefit in doing so. he may say to them, "may future bring good to you,"
~~or something of that nature. الإسلام دين لا يدعو إلى العنف

~~في الدولة الاسلامية human rights in an islamic state PageV01P0111
# human rights in an islamic state 1. the security of life and property:
~~in the address which the prophet delivered on the occasion of the
~~farewell hajj, he said: "your lives and properties are forbidden to one
~~another till you meet your lord on the day of resurrection." the prophet
~~has also said about the dhimmis (the non-muslim citizens of the muslim
~~state): "one who kills a man under covenant (i.e., dhimmi) will not even
~~smell the fragrance of paradise." 2. the protection of honor: the holy
~~quran lays down: "you who believe, do not let one (set of) people make
~~fun of another set." "do not defame one another." "do not insult by
~~using nicknames." "do not backbite or speak ill of one another."
~~(49:11-12) 3. sanctity and security of private life: the quran has laid
~~down the injunction: "do not spy on one another." (49:12) "do not enter
~~any houses unless you are sure of their occupant's consent." (24:27) 4.
~~the security of personal freedom: islam has laid down the principle that
~~no citizen can be imprisoned unless his guilt has been proven in an open
~~court. to arrest a man only on the basis of suspicion and to throw him
~~into a prison without proper court proceedings and without providing him
~~a reasonable opportunity to produce his defense is not permissible in
~~islam. 5. the right to protest against tyranny: among the rights that
~~islam has conferred on human beings is the right to protest against
~~government's tyranny. referring to it the quran says: "god does not love
~~evil talk in public unless it is by someone who has been injured
~~thereby. PageV01P0112
# " (4:148) in islam, as has been argued earlier, all power and
~~authority belong to god, and with man there is only delegated power
~~which becomes a trust; everyone who becomes a recipient of such a power
~~has to stand in awful reverence before his people toward whom and for
~~whose sake he will be called upon to use these powers. this was
~~acknowledged by hazrat abu bakr who said in his very first address:
~~"cooperate with me when i am right but correct me when i commit error;
~~obey me so long as i follow the commandments of allah and his prophet;
~~but turn away from me when i deviate." 6. freedom of expression: islam
~~gives the right of freedom of thought and expression to all citizens of
~~the islamic state on the condition that it should be used for the
~~propagation of virtue and truth and not for spreading evil and
~~wickedness. the islamic concept of freedom of expression is much
~~superior to the concept prevalent in the west. under no circumstances
~~would islam allow evil and wickedness to be propagated. it also does not
~~give anybody the right to use abusive or offensive language in the name
~~of criticism. it was the practice of the muslims to enquire from the
~~holy prophet whether on a certain matter a divine injunction had been
~~revealed to him. if he said that he had received no divine injunction,
~~the muslims freely expressed their opinion on the matter. 7. freedom of
~~association: islam has also given people the right to freedom of
~~association and formation of parties or organizations. this right is
~~also subject to certain general rules. 8. PageV01P0113
# freedom of conscience and conviction: islam has laid down the
~~injunction: "there should be no coercion in the matter of faith."
~~(2:256) on the contrary, totalitarian societies totally deprive the
~~individuals of their freedom. indeed, this undue exaltation of the state
~~authority curiously enough postulates a sort of servitude, of
~~slavishness on the part of man. at one time slavery meant total control
~~of man over man - now that type of slavery has been legally abolished
~~but in its place totalitarian societies impose a similar sort of control
~~over individuals. 9. protection of religious sentiments: along with the
~~freedom of conviction and freedom of conscience, islam has given the
~~right to the individual that his religious sentiments will be given due
~~respect and nothing will be said or done which may encroach upon his
~~right. 10. protection from arbitrary imprisonment: islam also recognizes
~~the right of the individual not to be arrested or imprisoned for the
~~offenses of others. the holy quran has laid down this principle clearly:
~~"no bearer of burdens shall be made to bear the burden of another."
~~(35:18) 11. the right to basic necessities of life: islam has recognized
~~the right of the needy people for help and assistance to be provided to
~~them: "and in their wealth there is acknowledged right for the needy and
~~the destitute." (51:19) 12. equality before law: islam gives its
~~citizens the right to absolute and complete equality in the eyes of the
~~law. 13. rulers not above the law: a woman belonging to a high and noble
~~family was arrested in connection with theft. PageV01P0114
# the case was brought to the prophet, and it was recommended that she
~~might be spared the punishment of theft. the prophet replied: "the
~~nations that lived before you were destroyed by god because they
~~punished the common man for their offenses and let their dignitaries go
~~unpunished for their crimes; i swear by him who holds my life in his
~~hand that even if fatima, the daughter of muhammad, had committed this
~~crime, i would have amputated her hand." 14. the right to participate in
~~the affairs of state: "and their business is (conducted) through
~~consultation among themselves." (42:38) the "shura" or the legislative
~~assembly has no other meaning except that the executive head of the
~~government and the members of the assembly should be elected by free and
~~independent choice of the people. lastly, it is to be made clear that
~~islam tries to achieve the above mentioned human rights and many others
~~not only by providing certain legal safeguards but mainly by inviting
~~mankind to transcend the lower level of animal life to be able to go
~~beyond the mere ties fostered by the kinship of blood, racial
~~superiority, linguistic arrogance, and economic privileges. it invites
~~mankind to move on to a plane of existence where, by reason of his inner
~~excellence, man can realize the ideal of the brotherhood of man. 11-

~~call upon the world to take the islamic principals of equality and

~~greatest example on the uniting the world. in the existence of islam

~~13- islamic reform in the domain of worship 1 PageV01P0124
# islamic reform in the domain of worship islam came at a time when
~~there were many forms of worship in the world. some of these were
~~remnants of the previous divinely revealed ******ures. others were
~~completely man-made. even those acts of worship that were of divine
~~origin had been corrupted, altered, and removed from their proper
~~con****s. some religions exaggerated the importance of formalism and
~~mindless ritual. others went to extremes to free themselves of all
~~notions of form and order. some religions went to extremes that made
~~worship a harmful and painful thing. some of them also demanded
~~monasticism from their adherents. other religions went to extremes in
~~indulgence, often completely abandoning religious obligations
~~altogether. islam came to correct and reform these excessive tendencies,
~~while establishing principles of its own. it provided principles to
~~bring about reform and to safeguard worship. the most important of these
~~principles are as follows: 1. no one deserves to be worshipped except
~~for allah: the first thing that islam came with was the concept of
~~monotheism. bearing witness to monotheism is how a person enters into
~~the fold of islam and is considered to be a believer. the testimony is
~~as follows: “there is no god but allah. muhammad is the messenger of
~~allah.” these words are a testimony that there is no one worthy of
~~worship except for allah. in this way, islam negates every possible
~~manifestation of polytheism. the following are some of the ways that
~~islam safeguards the idea of monotheism: a. PageV01P0125
# islam makes polytheism a cause of negating the effects of good works
~~and as a way of leaving the fold of islam. allah addresses his messenger
~~(may the peace and blessings of allah be upon him) with the following
~~words: “it has been revealed to you and to those who came before you: if
~~you commit polytheism, your deeds will be naught and you will be among
~~the losers.” b. islam closes all the doors to polytheism. it pays
~~careful attention to all the ways polytheism can be prevented. among
~~these are the following: - the messenger (may the peace and blessings of
~~allah be upon him) prohibited the people from honoring him excessively,
~~because this could lead to excessiveness in belief. he made it clear
~~that he was merely a slave of allah and his messenger. he said: “do not
~~praise me excessively the way that the christians praised `isâ (jesus)
~~the son of maryam (mary). i am only allah’s slave and messenger so say
~~that i am his slave and messenger.” - he prohibited people from seeking
~~assistance through him or through the agency of any other righteous
~~person. it has been related that one of the hypocrites used to abuse the
~~believers, so some of the believers suggested that they collectively
~~seek help from that hypocrite by means of allah’s messenger (may the
~~peace and blessings of allah be upon him). the prophet (may the peace
~~and blessings of allah be upon him) said: “none should seek help through
~~me. help should be sought from allah alone.” c. the prophet (may the
~~peace and blessings of allah be upon him) prohibited people from turning
~~gravesites into places of worship. PageV01P0126
# he strongly warned against this practice. near the time of his death,
~~he repeatedly mentioned this prohibition. he would say: “allah’s wrath
~~became severe towards those people who turned the graves of their
~~prophets into places of worship.” d. the prophet (may the peace and
~~blessings of allah be upon him) prohibited people from taking oaths in
~~other than allah’s name, because an oath implies the aggrandizement of
~~the one in whose name it is taken. the prophet (may the peace and
~~blessings of allah be upon him) said: “whoever takes an oath in other
~~than allah’s name has fallen into polytheism.” e. the prophet (may the
~~peace and blessings of allah be upon him) prohibited people from
~~performing sacrifices to other than allah. he said: “allah has cursed
~~those who offer sacrifices to other than allah.” 14- الإصلاح الاسلامي
~~للعبادة (2) 14- islamic reform in the domain of worship 2 PageV01P0127
# islamic reform in the domain of worship - ii worship must be free from
~~the authority of priests a. the previous manifestations of the divine
~~religion were corrupted when their priests concocted many rituals and
~~rites that were never part of allah’s law. these rituals enabled them to
~~take control of the devout and affect their minds so that they were
~~never satisfied with their own devotions. this made them dependent on
~~the clergy in performing their prayers. they were made to believe that
~~they needed these rituals and rites that were under the control of the
~~priests. islam came with everything needed to reform this situation and
~~prevent it from reoccurring. one way it did this was to free the heart
~~of attachment to any authority besides the authority of allah. every
~~believer has a direct relationship with allah and has no need for
~~intermediaries. furthermore, taking intermediaries is considered a form
~~of polytheism, even if these intermediaries are the noble messengers
~~themselves. allah has opened the door of prayer and supplication to
~~everyone and has ordered the believers to call on him directly. allah
~~says: “your lord said: beseech me, i will answer you. verily those who
~~are too proud to worship me will enter hell.” allah addresses his
~~messenger (may the peace and blessings of allah be upon him) saying:
~~“and when my worshippers ask you about me, i am nearby. i answer the
~~supplications of those who ask when they ask of me. so they should
~~answer me and believe in me, perhaps they will be rightly guided.” the
~~scholars’ role in islam is merely to explain the laws of islam.
~~PageV01P0128
# allah says: “ask those who know – if you do not know – the clear signs
~~and ******ures.” b. islam also frees worship from the constraints of
~~time and place. it has made all places suitable for worship in the same
~~way that it has opened up the way for the worshipper to call on his or
~~her lord directly. allah says: “to allah belongs the east and the west,
~~so wherever you turn, there is the countenance of your lord.” allah’s
~~messenger (may the peace and blessings of allah be upon him) said: “the
~~earth has been made a mosque and a source of purification for me. anyone
~~of my followers who has to pray should pray wherever he may be.” this is
~~a general rule, having no exception other than the hajj pilgrimage that
~~is to be performed specifically at al-masjid al-harâm in mecca to
~~rekindle the memory of ibrâhîm (abraham), the father of the prophets.
~~islam prescribes specific times for certain acts of worship, like the
~~five prescribed prayers. allah says: “establish prayer at the forenoon
~~until the nightfall, and recite the dawn prayer. verily the recitation
~~of the dawn prayer carries special testimony." allah says regarding the
~~hajj pilgrimage: “the hajj is in well-known months.” other acts of
~~worship can be performed at any time. 3. islamic worship maintains a
~~balance between body and soul one of the ways in which the religions
~~before islam became corrupted is with regard to the relationship between
~~the body and the soul. some groups went to excess in spirituality.
~~others were taken completely by materialism. PageV01P0129
# islam, on the other hand, avoided these extremes and returned worship
~~to its original, true form that balances between the material and the
~~spiritual. it established some very important principles in this regard,
~~such as the following: 1. islam recognizes the needs of both the body
~~and the soul. allah’s messenger (may the peace and blessings of allah be
~~upon him) said: “your lord has rights over you, your body has rights
~~over you, and your family has rights over you. so give everything its
~~right.” allah says: “seek the hereafter with what allah gives you, but
~~do not forget your share of this world.” islam provides sustenance for
~~the soul through worship and obedience to allah and allows sustenance
~~for the body by making all good things lawful. 2. islam considers the
~~worldly life the place to cultivate the rewards of the hereafter. islam
~~makes the primary occupation of the human being on earth the development
~~of all good things by which a believer benefits himself and others.
~~islam recognizes no dichotomy between the sacred and the secular. no
~~does it see a conflict between this world and the hereafter. this world
~~is a means of earning the next, therefore we find that allah teaches his
~~worshippers to beseech him in the following manner: “our lord, give us
~~the good of this world and the good of the hereafter and save us from
~~the punishment of the hellfire.” 4. islamic worship is easy and free of
~~excessive hardship islam came with its law easy in every way. it eschews
~~the excessive hardship that can be found in the religions of the past.
~~PageV01P0130
# allah says this in clear terms: “whoever is compelled, neither
~~desiring it nor returning to it (unlawful meat), then there is no sin
~~upon him.” there is a well-established principle in islamic law:
~~hardship is a reason for concessions. all of the concessions found in
~~islamic law fall under this principle. for example, it is permissible
~~for a traveler to shorten his prayers and to break his obligatory fast
~~in the month of ramadân. allah says: “allah wants ease for you and does
~~not want hardship.” 15- فوائد العبادة 15- the purpose of worship
~~PageV01P0131
# the purpose of worship worship provides the believers with many
~~benefits that contribute to both their spiritual and worldly well-being.
~~some of the most significant of these benefits are as follows: 1.
~~enrichment and development of the soul: the human being is formed from
~~matter. the human body needs material resources for its existence, like
~~food, drink, and a means of reproduction. as for the soul, its needs
~~cannot be fulfilled except through nearness to allah by means of faith
~~and obedience. this can only be achieved through worship. allah must be
~~worshipped in times of hardship and times of prosperity. allah says: “we
~~truly know how your heart is distressed by what they say. so celebrate
~~the praises of your lord and be of those who prostrate themselves and
~~worship your lord until the sure hour (of death).” allah says: “when the
~~help of allah and the victory comes and you see the people entering into
~~the religion of allah in crowds, then glorify the praises of your lord
~~and seek his forgiveness. verily he is most forgiving.” 2. realization
~~of human freedom: worship liberates the human being from subjugation to
~~anything besides allah. worship keeps a person from surrendering his or
~~her will to false gods. this gives a person absolute freedom from
~~everything besides the power of allah. this produces a sense of security
~~and *******ment in the heart towards allah. the person understands the
~~true value of things and feels liberated from everything. thus, the
~~source of all strength is submission to allah. allah says: “if anyone
~~seeks might, then all might is with allah.” 3. PageV01P0132
# examination of the believer in preparation for the life to come: allah
~~says, quoting mûsâ (moses, peace be upon him): “o my people, this
~~worldly life is but a provision, while the hereafter is the eternal
~~abode.” the worldly life is a time of trial. the substance of this trial
~~is the worship of allah in fulfillment of his commandments. allah says:
~~“(allah is) who created death and life to try you as to who is best in
~~deeds.” 4. social reform: we find that worship, in it most comprehensive
~~understanding, embodies every possible means of individual and social
~~reform. this is because every individual and collective endeavor can
~~enter into the domain of worship. islam has prescribed certain
~~obligations on the societal – as opposed to the individual – level. this
~~takes societal needs into consideration. allah says: “allah has promised
~~those among you who believe and do righteous deeds that he will give
~~them authority in the earth as he has done for those who came before and
~~that he will establish their religion that he wants to replace their
~~fear with security. they may worship me and not associate partners with
~~me.” . source http://www.islamtoday.com/showme.cfm?cat_id=4&sub_cat_id=3
~~16- ماالسر وراء حفظ الاسلام لكل حقوق مخلوقات الكون ..؟ 16- why does
~~islam concern with all creatures rights PageV01P0133
# why does islam concern with all creatures rights since the creator is
~~the most merciful , he doesn’t leave his creatures without a law that
~~guarantees their rights and protects their safety. this law is the true
~~religion revealed by the almighty. this religion has a great effect on
~~the all aspects of life for those who adhere it. each one is protected &
~~honored by this divine religion. likewise, people's rights- regardless
~~of their sex, position, religion & age-are respected. these rights are
~~ensured in the nobel quran and in the sayings of allah's apostle peace
~~and blessings be upon him. as an example not as restriction ,the
~~following verses and prophet sayings will be mentioned: the right of
~~parents: god says"your lord has decreed that you worship non but him,
~~and that (you show) kindness to parents. should one or both of them
~~attain to old age with you, say not "fie'' unto them nor repulse them,
~~but speak unto them a gracious word. and lower unto them the wing of
~~submission through mercy and say: my lord! have mercy on them both as
~~they did care for me when i was little. your lord is best aware of what
~~is in yourselves. PageV01P0134
# if you are righteous, then lo! he was ever forgiving unto those who
~~turn unto him)" the rights of old and young, the prophet says: " he is
~~not of us who does not have mercy on young children, nor honor the
~~elderly" the right of orphans is to treat them kindly and justly ,the
~~prophet says: ''the best muslim house is that in which is an orphan, who
~~is benefited; and the worst muslim house is that in which an orphan is
~~ill-treated" and he appreciates the one who esteems the daughters rights
~~;the prophet says"' whoever has a daughter, and does not bury her alive
~~or scold her, or prefer his male children to her, may god bring him into
~~paradise" one of the main rights in islam is to respect man's property
~~and his blood, prophet says' man's property is as sacred as his blood"
~~in this divine law, non-believers must be protected ,allah's apostle
~~says : "he who hurts a covenanted man hurts me .and he who hurts me
~~hurts god" furthermore, animals' rights should be respected, otherwise
~~,we would deserve god's punishment, the prophet says : "a woman was
~~punished (by god) because of a cat. PageV01P0135
# she had not provided (the cat) with food or drink, nor had she set it
~~free so that it might eat the insects of the earth" the arousing
~~question is why does islam concern with all creatures rights? 1- it is
~~an evidence for "islam divine source" god wants us to live the" perfect
~~life" then , he sends a law as a tool for this purpose to protect our
~~rights in this world and to find the complete rest in worshipping
~~him,that is islam 2- it is an evidence for its noble aim ''building the
~~human civilizations not destruct them'' hundreds of quranic verses and
~~prophet sayings ask us to be kind with other and wipe their miserable
~~and to be helpful with them , god says "(the righteous are those) who
~~feed the poor, the orphan and the captive for the love of god, saying:
~~'we feed you for the sake of god alone; we seek from you neither reward
~~nor thanks'' some other verses heighten the position of the positive
~~workers who work for all creatures benefits, prophet says: "all
~~creatures are like a family (ayal) of god: and he loves the most those
~~who are the most beneficent to his family". and in the contrary, god
~~censures those who ruin anything around them, he says: '" work not
~~confusion in the earth after the fair ordering (thereof). and call on
~~him in fear and hope. PageV01P0136
# lo! the mercy of allah is nigh unto the good'"' ',and we are
~~encouraged by this divine law to build ,to feed , to product, and to
~~farm ,the prophet says :''if a muslim plants a tree or grows a crop from
~~which a bird or a man or an animal eats ,it will be considered (by
~~god)as a charitable act''' 3- it is an evidence for "its conformity"
~~with the human pure nature, it is impossible to find any command from
~~islamic commands contradicts with the human pure nature cause both of
~~islam and human pure nature come from the same source ''the almighty
~~god'' for example the big sins in islam are disapproved by reasonable
~~thinking, the prophet muhammad (peace be upon him) said, '' avoid the
~~seven destructive sins : associating partners with god ,magic ,murder,
~~usury, eating the orphans property , escaping from battle, and
~~slandering chaste heedless women" the one who creates us is the best one
~~who knows what is good & what is bad.similary, allah doesn't ask man to
~~do that which he cannot.or which contradicts his nature .god says" so
~~set thy purpose (o muhammad) for religion as a man by nature upright -
~~the nature (framed) of allah, in which he hath created man. there is no
~~altering (the laws of) allah's creation. that is the right religion, but
~~most men know not'' 17- الطوائف الإسلامية 17- schisms in islam
~~PageV01P0137
# schisms in islam several schools evolved among muslims. the majority
~~of muslims belong to the school called ahlul sunnah wal jamaat. shiites
~~muslims constitute the largest minority. the former follow the teachings
~~of prophet muhammad as interpreted by the four imams: imam abu hanifa,
~~imam ahmed bin hambal, imam malik and imam shafi. the latter follow the
~~interpretation of the teachings of prophet muhammad, interpreted by imam
~~ali and imams from his family. the differences among muslims occurred
~~after the death of prophet muhammad, in regard to his succession, and
~~were of a political nature. the sunni muslims believe that the
~~succession to muhammad was left up to the people to decide, whereas the
~~shiites muslims believe that prophet muhammad had designated his cousin
~~and son-in-law ali as his successor. since then kings, rulers, religious
~~leaders have exploited these differences in order to achieve their
~~selfish and material objectives. it must be emphasized that he
~~fundamentals of the faith are common to all muslims. all muslims believe
~~in one god. all muslims follow one book, the qur’an. all muslims believe
~~in prophet muhammad and strive to emulate him. all muslims agree upon
~~the basic tenets of islam. 18- تحدي الجهل بالإسلام 18- challenging

# challenging ignorance on islam by gary leupp "we should invade

~~king." allegedly written in marker by law enforcement agents on a muslim
~~prayer calendar in the home of a muslim being investigated by police in
~~dearborn, michigan, july 2002. people with power and influence in the us
~~have been saying some very stupid things about islam and about muslims
~~since september 11. some of it is rooted in conscious malice, and ethnic
~~prejudice that spills over into religious bigotry. but some is rooted in
~~sheer historical and geographical ignorance. this is a country, after
~~all, in which only a small minority of high school students can readily
~~locate afghanistan on the map, or are aware that iranians and pakistanis
~~are not arabs. PageV01P0139
# as an educator, in asian studies, at a fairly elite university, i am
~~painfully aware of this ignorance. but i realize it serves a purpose. it
~~is highly useful to a power structure that banks on knee-jerk popular
~~support whenever it embarks on a new military venture, at some far-off
~~venue, on false pre****s immediately discernable to the better educated,
~~but lost on the general public. the generally malleable mainstream press
~~takes care of the rest. i don't mean to suggest that the academic
~~cognosenti, as a "class," habitually counter this ignorance and protest
~~the imperialist interventions that washington routinely undertakes. some
~~of them may indeed support the venture, cynically asserting that the
~~advertised pre**** fulfills some sort of valid function, regardless of
~~the lies and distortions that surround it. (i think of the depiction in
~~the media of the "rambouillet accords" concerning yugoslavia in 1999 as
~~"the will of the international community," when one contact group
~~member, russia, rejected the us-dictated plan for kosovo outright, and
~~several european states only signed on after their arms were twisted
~~nearly out of their sockets. i think of the calculated, extreme
~~exaggeration of the number of kosovar victims of serbian forces as the
~~bombing of yugoslavia began. the lies surrounding that bombing were
~~obvious to anyone studying the situation, but even some rather
~~progressive academics were all for "operation allied force.") american
~~academe is---unfortunately--- whatever its right-wing critics may
~~contend, not particularly left or anti-imperialist. PageV01P0140
# in any case, such ignorance is not just a national embarrassment; it's
~~really dangerous. raw material for a made-in-usa version of fascism. to
~~understand the contemporary world, we all need to know something about
~~islam - beyond the inane contribution of the attorney general cited
~~above. so i have prepared this little primer on islam for americans
~~(suitable for ages 13 and above, so appropriate for high school use),
~~dealing not with its theology so much as its general character as an
~~important force in the world, presently encountering unprecedented,
~~unprincipled attack from various quarters. (oh, and by the way, i'm not
~~a muslim, but what those on the christian right revile as a "secular
~~humanist.") 1. islam has been around for approximately 1400 years.
~~established on the west coast of arabia 900 years before european
~~settlement in america, and spreading rapidly throughout southwest asia
~~and north africa soon thereafter, it was not designed as an anti-u.s.
~~movement! the basic teachings or requirements of islam are not difficult
~~to grasp. they constitute the "five pillars of islam": (1) profession
~~that there is no god but god ("allah," in arabic), and his prophet (the
~~last of the prophets, the "seal of the prophets") is muhammad; (2) daily
~~prayer; (3) fasting during the month of ramadan; (4) charity; and (5)
~~the pilgrimage to mecca. whatever you may think of this package, it's
~~not terribly threatening to the non-muslim. 2. PageV01P0141
# islam's teachings are contained in a fairly compact book, the qur'an,
~~which muslims believe was dictated to the prophet muhammad by the
~~archangel gabriel. they believe of it precisely what jews and christians
~~believe of their ******ures: that is, it's the word of god. this book,
~~like the bible, demands belief in monotheism; refers to adam, noah,
~~abraham, jesus, etc. (far more space is given to mary, mother of jesus,
~~in the qur'an than in the new testament); has a substantial legalistic
~~component reminiscent of the old testament book of leviticus, and poetic
~~******* as beautifully uplifting as the book of psalms. for religious
~~and secular scholars alike, it is absolutely clear that islam stems from
~~the judeo-christian tradition. indeed, we should think in terms of the
~~"judeo-christian-islamic tradition." (some fundamentalist christians, of
~~course, see islam as the work of satan, and medieval christians in
~~europe saw it as a heresy rather than as "paganism. the point is---for
~~better or worse---muslims have a whole lot more in common with the
~~dominant religious trends in the u.s. than do, say, buddhists or
~~hindus.) 3. muslims are about 20% of the world's population; christians,
~~about 30%. (the u.s. muslim population is estimated between 5 and 8
~~million; u.s. jews between 5 and 6 million). the global jewish
~~population is statistically quite small, so one can say the judeo-
~~christian-islamic population is roughly half the world's total. the
~~consequences of a protracted religious war, pitting christians and jews
~~against muslims, are highly unpleasant to consider. 4. PageV01P0142
# the qur'an depicts jews and christians as "people of the book,"
~~meaning that they have their own ******ures bestowed upon them by god
~~(allah is simply the arabic world for god, related to the hebrew elohim;
~~we should see it as analogous to the german word gott, the french dieu,
~~or the spanish dios. it's not the personal name of a deity within a
~~pantheon, like thor, aphrodite or siva.) muslim ******ure counsels
~~respect for these communities, and indeed, in the history of islam,
~~within islamic societies jews and christians have fared far better than
~~non-christians in christendom. muslims ruled all or part of spain from
~~around 800 to the late 15th century, when columbus' great patrons, king
~~ferdinand and queen isabella "drove the moors (muslims) out of spain,"
~~forced everybody to embrace catholic christianity (or be killed), and
~~promoted the exquisite christian tortures of the inquisition. under
~~muslim rule, christian and jewish communities generally flourished from
~~spain to iraq. on the other hand, until recent times, christian
~~intolerance prevailed throughout europe. 5. the qu'ran does not call
~~upon muslims to kill all non-muslims. it calls for the destruction of
~~"infidels," meaning principally arabs who, during the time of muhammad,
~~practiced idolatry and polytheism. again: this is a seventh-century
~~book, produced in a specific historical con****! it, and the muslim
~~religion, should be studied and understood objectively, dispassionately.
~~islam emerged very quickly, and within decades united under its banner-
~~the banner of monotheism---the various tribes of arabia. PageV01P0143
# its violent rejection of idolatry, however offensive to the modern,
~~secular, humanist mind, is hardly unique. it can be compared to the
~~ferocious suppression in christian europe of paganism (often associated
~~with witchcraft). and for perspective, while the qu'ran does call for
~~the extermination of "infidels," the old testament is replete with its
~~own exhortations to genocide. according to the biblical narrative (of
~~dubious historicity, but believed by hundreds of millions), the hebrews
~~under joshua's leadership, invading canaan from egypt, killed twelve
~~thousand "men and women together" in the town of ai-because god wanted
~~them to (joshua 8:25). the hebrews put all the people of hazor to the
~~sword (they "wiped them all out; they did not leave one living soul."
~~judges 11:14). the poetics of hatred are as conspicuous in the bible as
~~in the qu'ran. a personal favorite of mine, from psalm 137, refers to
~~the babylonians: "a blessing on him who takes and dashes your babies
~~against the rock!" such references are characteristic of judeo-
~~christian-islamic literature, and are best examined in historical
~~perspective. 6. islamic "fundamentalism" is not a species apart from
~~other fundamentalisms, including the christian, jewish, and hindu
~~varieties. they are all anti-modern, anti-science, anti-intellectual,
~~rarely harmless and potentially (if not necessarily) fascistic. they
~~demand belief in received dogma, inscribed in ****s, rather than open-
~~ended scientific inquiry. PageV01P0144
# they either legitimate the existing order, or call for a return to a
~~past social order in which class and gender relations were properly
~~sorted out in line with the divine will. some (including non-religious
~~people in or from muslim countries) criticize islam (appropriately, in
~~my view) for what they consider backward and reactionary features. this
~~is not the place to deal with such criticisms, nor am i the right person
~~to do it. i will merely observe what many others have observed:
~~christendom underwent the enlightenment-an evolution towards secularism,
~~rationalism, and scientific thought in the seventeenth and eighteenth
~~centuries-which the islamic world, in general, has not yet experienced.
~~to become "modern" (more specifically, to become capitalist), the west
~~had to become more ideologically tolerant (i.e., less religious), and
~~allow a freer market in ideas than had been possible when the church
~~monopolized learning. if mullahs monopolize education in much of the
~~muslim world, they serve a function identical with that of europe's
~~medieval catholic clergy. but our own enlightenment is not irreversible.
~~top u.s. officials reject the theory of evolution in favor of the
~~ludicrous "theory" of "creationism," and seek to criminalize abortion on
~~the grounds that a fetus is a human being created by god. recent changes
~~in u.s. PageV01P0145
# law (allowing the use of vouchers to support religious schools at
~~taxpayer's expense), and the failure of the courts to prosecute behavior
~~which plainly violates the constitutional separation of church and
~~state, demonstrate that medieval thinking and fundamentalism retain a
~~strong hold in sections of u.s. society, and are well represented in the
~~bush administration. the american people are, i submit, far more
~~threatened by christian fundamentalism than its islamic counterpart. and
~~for a pentecostalist christian like john ashcroft, who believes every
~~word of the bible literally, to inveigh against islam (as he has) is (to
~~use the english proverb) the "pot calling the kettle black." 7. islamic
~~fundamentalism (or what some, including cnn moneyline's lou dobbs calls
~~"islamism," meaning a specifically political islam) has not,
~~historically, posed a great threat to western interests (by which i mean
~~corporate, oil, and geopolitical interests) but rather been exploited to
~~serve those interests. remember lawrence of arabia? what was his
~~objective other than to forge a british alliance with the hashemites,
~~who would certainly qualify as "islamists" by lou dobb's standards,
~~during world war i? later, the british boosted the saudi royal family
~~(patrons of the wahhabi school of islam, usually described as among the
~~most conservative, embraced by osama bin laden as well as the saudis in
~~general) into power. the u.s. inherited saudi arabia as a client state
~~after world war ii, and we all know how well u.s. oil companies have
~~done there ever since. PageV01P0146
# (aramco alone, prior to its nationalization in the mid-1980s, yielded
~~some $ 3 trillion from the arabian reserves.) the u.s. helped create,
~~recruit, and finance the fundamentalist mujahadeen, including some
~~30,000 young volunteers who came from throughout the muslim world to
~~fight "godless communism" in afghanistan in the 1980s. the u.s.
~~encouraged them to view their war as a jihad (in the sense of a "holy
~~war," a meaning the term usually does not carry), and put many in
~~contact with young osama bin laden, then an ally. the reagan
~~administration was in love with fundamentalist islam, so long as it
~~served its purposes. the california-based company unocal was cordially
~~negotiating right up to sept. 11 with afghanistan's taliban for an oil
~~pipeline through afghan territory, state department official and oilman
~~zalmay khalilzad was arguing up through 1998 that the taliban were
~~friendly, potential business partners who did "not practice the
~~anti-u.s. style of fundamentalism practiced in iran." 8. muslims of the
~~world have many thoroughly legitimate reasons to resent u.s. policy.
~~nearly absolute support for the settler state of israel in its
~~relationship with the indigenous palestinian people. imposition of
~~brutal sanctions on iraq, contrary to logic and morality. maintenance of
~~bases throughout the persian gulf, in defiance of local sensibilities
~~and interests. support for brutal regimes, including that of the shah of
~~iran and that of indonesia's suharto (who unquestionably has more blood
~~on his hands than even that arch-villain and former u.s. buddy saddam
~~hussein). 9. PageV01P0147
# muslims typically do not hate the u.s. as an abstract concept, reject
~~u.s. culture in toto, or seek the destruction of american civilization.
~~many are, indeed, uncomfortable with some aspects of american behavior,
~~as are most people in the world, from central america to japan. but a
~~zogby international poll, released june 11 of this year, shows that in
~~nine muslim countries, including bangladesh and malaysia, the most
~~admired foreign country is the u.s. 10. muslims and jews in
~~palestine/israel have not always hated one another, and the current
~~middle east conflict does not go back many centuries. rather, it began
~~with the influx of foreign jews into the region after world war i, which
~~became a flood as a result of the holocaust, and with international
~~support resulted in the formation of israel as a specifically jewish
~~state in 1948. jewish settlement and terrorism (well-********ed by the
~~jewish israeli historian ilan pappe) resulted in the displacement of
~~750,000 palestinian arabs (including both christians and muslims). the
~~arab-israeli conflict is not, fundamentally, about islam, or a clash
~~between islam and other faiths, but about this-worldly land grabbing,

~~christians seeking to "win back for christendom" territory that had
~~fallen to the muslim turks-territory that had been ruled by muslims
~~since the early seventh century anyway, on terms generally agreeable to
~~jews and christians as well as muslims-committed unspeakable atrocities.
~~in july 1099 jerusalem was conquered, the roman catholic soldiers
~~massacring all the muslim and jewish inhabitants, including women and
~~children. nor was the crusaders' zeal exhausted upon non-christians;
~~frustrated at lack of success in palestine in 1204, they instead sacked
~~constantinople (modern istanbul), then the center of eastern orthodoxy.
~~in comparison, the behavior of the muslim armies was chivalrous, the
~~twelfth-century kurdish leader saladin in particular winning high praise
~~from christians and muslims alike for his humanity. the islamic world
~~remembers the crusades; george bush, like many americans, is clueless
~~about them. hence his amazingly dim-witted reference to the "war on

# answering some misconceptions about islam islam rejects jesus because:
~~jesus is not accepted as `the son of god' ***************** the qur'an
~~and sunnah both teach us emphatically and without any doubt that the
~~creator considers the statement of the trinity to be a great falsehood.
~~the qur'an states (translation): [19:88-93] they say: "(allah) the most
~~merciful has begotten a son!" indeed you have put forth a thing most
~~monstrous! at it the skies are ready to burst, the earth to split
~~asunder, and the mountains to fall down in utter ruin, that they should
~~invoke a son for (allah) the most merciful. for it is not consonant with
~~the majesty of (allah) the most merciful that he should beget a son: not
~~one of the beings in the heavens and the earth but must come to (allah)
~~the most merciful as a servant. however, the misconception that jesus is
~~rejected does not follow from the reason given above. it is more precise
~~to say that identifying jesus as `the son of god' is rejected. as a
~~messenger of allah, jesus is accorded the same honor that all the
~~messengers are given, as the following verse attests to (translation),
~~[2:136] say (o muslims): we believe in allah and that which is revealed
~~to us and that which was revealed to abraham, and ishmael, and isaac,
~~and jacob, and the tribes, and that which moses and jesus received, and
~~that which the prophets received from their lord. we make no distinction

~~************************************************** ************ islam is
~~a racist, afro-centric cult because: nation of islam espouses the
~~superiority of the black man ************ one of the great
~~misconceptions of the twentieth century is that the so-called `nation of
~~islam' is a muslim community, or more precisely: a community which
~~submits to allah by following the qur'an and sunnah. the `nation of
~~islam' is a man-made way of life which borrowed some elements of islam
~~and then mixed them with a large number of inventions and lies to reach
~~their present doctrines. it suffices to point out the `nation of islam's
~~deviation in two areas. first, they reject the essence of islam by
~~concocting a story wherein the creator takes the form of a black man.
~~from their on-line publications, we find that the `nation of islam'
~~believes in ...one god (allah) and that allah (god) appeared in the
~~person of master w. fard muhammad, july, 1930; the long awaited
~~`messiah' of the christians and the `mahdi' of the muslims... however,
~~the creator states in the qur'an (translation), [6:103] no vision can
~~grasp him, but his grasp is over all vision: he is above all
~~comprehension, yet is acquainted with all things. the `nation of islam'
~~also claims that white men are `devils', and that black people are in
~~general superior to all other races. PageV01P0152
# however, from the sunnah, specifically in the messenger of allah's
~~farewell sermon, we find the messenger (pbuh) saying: all mankind is
~~from adam and eve, an arab has no superiority over a non-arab nor a non-
~~arab has any superiority over an arab; also a white has no superiority
~~over a black nor a black has any superiority over a white - except by
~~piety and good action. there are many other beliefs which the `nation of
~~islam' holds which take it outside of islam. it is interesting to note
~~that in the mid-1970's, the overwhelming majority of the group realized
~~its errors and converted to true islam. there is, however, a splinter
~~group which remains active today .
~~************************************************** ********** islam
~~produces a lazy, uneducated society because: fatalism is ok .
~~************** the reasons given for this misconception are false, and
~~the misconception itself is actually refuted directly by the qur'an and
~~sunnah. while it is true that the creator is the source of everything to
~~us, it is not true that this can be used as an excuse for humanity to
~~hide behind as the following verses from the qur'an state (translation),
~~[16:35] the worshippers of false gods say: "if allah had so willed, we
~~should not have worshipped anything but him - neither we nor our
~~fathers,- nor should we have prescribed prohibitions other than his." so
~~did those who went before them. PageV01P0153
# but what is the mission of messengers but to preach the clear message?
~~[43:20] they (the idolators) say, "if it had been the will of (allah)
~~the most merciful, we should not have worshipped such (deities)!" of
~~that they have no knowledge: they do nothing but lie! allah has taught
~~us via the qur'an and sunnah that we all have a certain amount of free
~~will. this free will must be exercised properly in accordance with the
~~qur'an and sunnah to please the creator. this is plenty of motivation
~~for all muslims to push themselves to be the most knowledgeable,
~~effective muslims they can be. if muslim societies today are not meeting
~~their potential, it is surely not due to their knowledge of islam,
~~rather it is their ignorance of this way of life. the importance of
~~seeking knowledge and working are made clear in the sunnah. from the
~~sunnah, specifically in the study of the sunnah called sunan abu-dawud,
~~we find: [9:1637] narrated anas ibn malik: a man of the ansar came to
~~the prophet (pbuh) and begged from him. he (the prophet) asked: have you
~~nothing in your house? he replied: yes, a piece of cloth, a part of
~~which we wear and a part of which we spread (on the ground), and a
~~wooden bowl from which we drink water. he said: bring them to me. he
~~then brought these articles to him and he (the prophet) took them in his
~~hands and asked: who will buy these? a man said: i shall buy them for
~~one dirham. he said twice or thrice: who will offer more than one
~~dirham? a man said: i shall buy them for two dirhams. PageV01P0154
# he gave these to him and took the two dirhams and, giving them to the
~~ansari, he said: buy food with one of them and hand it to your family,
~~and buy an axe and bring it to me. he then brought it to him. the
~~apostle of allah (pbuh) fixed a handle on it with his own hands and
~~said: go, gather firewood and sell it, and do not let me see you for a
~~fortnight. the man went away and gathered firewood and sold it. when he
~~had earned ten dirhams, he came to him and bought a garment with some of
~~them and food with the others. the apostle of allah (pbuh) then said:
~~this is better for you than that begging should come as a spot on your
~~face on the day of judgment. begging is right only for three people: one
~~who is in grinding poverty, one who is seriously in debt, or one who is
~~responsible for compensation and finds it difficult to pay. also from
~~the sunnah, specifically in the study of the sunnah called sunan ibn
~~majah, we find that the messenger of allah said: seeking knowledge is a
~~duty upon every muslim. knowledge of the qur'an and sunnah are clearly
~~the best types of knowledge, and knowledge which benefits humanity is
~~good as well. the qur'an and sunnah do not condemn the study of this
~~earth and in fact the creator encourages us to investigate the world we
~~live in according to the following verse from the qur'an (translation),
~~[3:190-191] behold! in the creation of the heavens and the earth, and
~~the alternation of night and day, there are indeed signs for people of
~~understanding. PageV01P0155
# people who celebrate the praises of allah, standing, sitting, and
~~lying down on their sides, and contemplate the (wonders of) creation in
~~the heavens and the earth, (with the thought): "our lord! not for
~~nothing have you created (all) this! glory to you! give us salvation
~~from the penalty of the fire."

# answering some misconceptions about islam 2 "women are deficient in
~~mind and religion" " the majority of people in hell are women" islam
~~honours women very high and many verses of the qur'an and practices of
~~the early muslims bear witness to the fact that woman is, at least, as
~~vital to life as man is, and that she is not inferior to man in any way
~~(in neither religion or intelligence). islam never belittles woman or
~~underestimates her role in the society. allah has made this clear in the
~~glorious qur’an, by stating shining examples of some women for the
~~believers– male and female- to emulate. in this con****, the glorious
~~qur’an says, “and allah citeth an example for those who believe: the
~~wife of pharaoh when she said: my lord! build for me a home with thee in
~~the garden, and deliver me from pharaoh and his work, and deliver me
~~from evil doing folk; and mary, daughter of imran, whose body was
~~chaste, therefor we breathed therein something of our spirit. and she
~~put faith in the words of her lord and his ******ures, and was of the
~~obedient. PageV01P0157
# ” (at-tahrim: 11-12) allah almighty and prophet muhammad praised the
~~good women, let us look at the following quotes from our islamic
~~sources: "for muslim men and women,- for believing men and women, for
~~devout men and women, for true men and women, for men and women who are
~~patient and constant, for men and women who humble themselves, for men
~~and women who give in charity, for men and women who fast (and deny
~~themselves), for men and women who guard their chastity, and for men and
~~women who engage much in god's praise,- for them has god prepared
~~forgiveness and great reward. (the noble quran, 33:35)" "the believers,
~~men and women, are protectors one of another: they enjoin what is just,
~~and forbid what is evil: they observe regular prayers, practise regular
~~charity, and obey god and his apostle. on them will god pour his mercy:
~~for god is exalted in power, wise. (the noble quran, 9:71)" in islam
~~women clearly have the right to forbid men what is evil, so this proofs
~~women aren’t inferior to men in religion or intelligence, since allah
~~swt gives women the right to correct men when they are wrong, and to
~~forbid them the evil. the hadith is authentic, the prophet (saaws) talks
~~about women not as a gender or a race or ethnic. he talks about sinful
~~people who deserve what they will have of destiny. if a man does the
~~same, he will have the same hell. this is the only way you can interpret
~~the hadith. the prophet (saaws) has explained what he says of shortage
~~of religion which is different from the chrisitian missionaries
~~interpretation or translation of religion. PageV01P0158
# he says, you are less commended to practice the religion, because of
~~menstruation. when he talks about lack of intellect, he does not talk
~~about potential of brain or capacity of talent or skill. a woman is
~~overloaded by being a mother or a babysitter or pregnant. all these
~~carriers are around the clock, because of what she is, she is always
~~likely to forget more than a man who is devoted to one career only.
~~allah is merciful, he forgives her and makes it easy for her when she is
~~not fully responsible to give a full testimony as a witness. nothing of
~~that is defaming a woman, there is not a law that discriminates a woman
~~to put her down. he said: "i have never seen among those who have a
~~deficiency in their intellect and their religion anyone more capable
~~than women of swaying the intellect of the most determined of men." he
~~is actually asserting here the power of women to influence men and sway
~~their opinion. this is one of the distinctions that women, in their
~~natures, have. he then went on to define precisely what he meant by
~~these deficiencies. in the remainder of the hadîth, some women asked
~~him: "o messenger of allah, what is this deficiency in our intelligence
~~and religion?" he replied: "isn't it that a woman's testimony as a
~~witness is half of the testimony of man?" they said: "yes." he said:
~~"this, then, is the deficiency in her intelligence. isn't it true that
~~when she is in her menses, she leaves off prayers and fasting?" they
~~said: "yes." he said: "this is the deficiency in her religion." these
~~are matters of islamic law. PageV01P0159
# a woman is neither sinful nor blameworthy because of the prayers and
~~fasts that she misses. she, in fact, receives blessings by obeying allah
~~and abstaining from those acts while she is menstruating. her testimony
~~as a witness is half that of men only in matters wherein she is
~~generally less versed than men. in other matters wherein women have
~~particular knowledge, like fosterage and virginity, the testimony of a
~~woman is accepted but not that of a man. allah's messenger (peace be
~~upon him) attested to the perfect character of four women: mary, asiyah
~~the wife of pharaoh, fâtimah, and khadîjah. he definitely did not mean
~~that these women did not go through menstruation. he was referring to
~~their good character, strength of intellect, and soundness of opinion. -
~~women are a bad omen. o mohammed said, " bad omen is in the woman, the
~~house and the horse." vol. 7:30 there are two hadiths related by al-
~~bukhari suggest that there is no bad omen at all, because the wording in
~~these hadiths is as follows: “if bad omen happens to be present, then it
~~may be in a house, a woman and a horse.” this implies that there is no
~~bad omen in reality; it is people who may feel that a particular house,
~~woman or horse brings bad luck. once again, this is a comment on what
~~takes place in reality and how people believe. it is phrased in the
~~conditional form to indicate disapproval of the whole idea of bad omen.
~~what actually happens is that people tend to attach any unfortunate
~~event to what they did recently. PageV01P0160
# if a good rider happens to have a fall, after having bought a new
~~horse, he accuses the horse of bringing bad omen. the cause of the fall
~~may have nothing to do with the horse, but still the thought of bad omen
~~may persist. the same is true with marriage or buying a house. these
~~three are so much involved in a person’s life that they become easy
~~targets for blame of our misfortunes. this is not the way a true
~~believer should react. a believer is one who is patient in adversity,
~~thankful for whatever may happen to him, knowing that it is all from
~~god. he compares his fortunes with those of people in more difficult
~~circumstances and thanks god for his blessings. & prophet mohammad pbuh
~~said : "(believing in) bad omen is (a form of) idolatry." - " women are
~~harmful to men" the arabic word which is translated into ‘affliction’ is
~~‘fitnah’ , this is wrong and not correct! the words ‘affliction’ cannot
~~be placed in the con**** of this hadith. the word ‘fitnah’ has different
~~meanings, the correct translation of this word depends on the con****.
~~the arabic word ‘fitnah’ means: "trial,discord,testing, temptation." ,
~~generally speaking, this is an arabic word meaning approximately
~~"struggle" or "trial," but which is often euphemistically used to refer
~~to a war. in the ‘encyclopedia brittanica online’ we read:
~~(arabic“trial” or “test”) in the islamic tradition, trials or
~~temptations that test the unity of the muslim community. PageV01P0161
# we know how a beautifull women can play with a man’s mind, she could
~~bring him (if she wants) in temptation to do forbidden things, a women
~~can control his mind by her beauty, this is what is ment by ‘harm’ or
~~‘harmfull’ to men in this hadith, she can impair a man’s mind and/ or
~~moral , change a man’s mind in a negative way, especially in the con****
~~of his religion dutys. we clearly see that a women in islam is not at
~~all compared to something evil, bad or a form of affliction, instead of
~~this the prophet (swa) called women the best enjoyment of the world.
~~qu’ran verse 30:21 “and among his signs is this, that he created for you
~~mates from among yourselves, that ye may dwell in tranquillity with
~~them, and he has put love and mercy between your (hearts): verily in
~~that are signs for those who reflect.” (surah ar-rum 21) allah swt says
~~clearly in the qu’ran that your mates / spouses (man / women) are ‘love
~~and mercy ‘ and not a form of affliction or turmoil! women are also
~~called protectors/friends of men in surah at-tawbah 71 ( this is
~~sufficient proof to show that ‘affliction’ is a wrong translation for
~~‘fitnah’ in the con**** of the hadith in question ) qu’ran vers 9:71 the
~~believers, men and women, are protectors one of another: they enjoin
~~what is just, and forbid what is evil: they observe regular prayers,
~~practise regular charity, and obey allah and his messenger. on them will
~~allah pour his mercy: for allah is exalted in power, wise. PageV01P0162
# (surah at-tawbah 71) meaning of the hadith in question: usama ibn zayd
~~reported that the prophet, may allah bless him and grant him peace,
~~said, "i have not left after me any temptation more harmful to men than
~~women." (riyad as saliheen chapter 35, nr 288, sahih muslim, book 036,
~~number 6604 and sahih bukhari volume 7, book 62, number 33) a man is
~~infatuated by a woman to the extent that his behavior changes in
~~character. he may be wise and intelligent, yet he could easily behave in
~~a way that is inconsistent with his intelligence and wisdom when he is
~~so infatuated. this is a case where a woman can control a man. "
~~mohammed married a 9 year old girl" allah has willed for this to happen
~~in order to keep the sirah (life) of prophet mohammad pbuh alive even
~~after his death, because she had fresh memory at a young age ,
~~remembered everything, & she was the first one in number of hadiths
~~(sayings & acts of prophet mohammad pbuh) she narrated. the prophet
~~muhammad (peace and blessings of allah be upon him) was the last of the
~~prophets and the best of creation; and 'a'isha was a very intelligent
~~and observant young girl with a very good memory. 'a'isha (may allah be
~~pleased with her) spent the next nine years of her life with the prophet
~~(peace and blessings of allah be upon him), and she grew into womanhood,
~~she remembered all that she saw and heard with great clarity, for to be
~~the wife of the prophet was even more than extraordinary. PageV01P0163
# so much happened around him - the quran continued to be revealed,
~~verses by verses, and people's hearts were constantly being turned over
~~and transformed, including hers and she was a witness of so much of all
~~that took place. it is not surprising, therefore, that a great deal of
~~the knowledge that we still have today, about how the prophet (peace and
~~blessings of allah be upon him) lived and behaved, was first remembered
~~and then taught to others by 'a'isha. it is thanks to this exceptional
~~marriage, between a man nearing the end of his life and a woman still
~~near the beginning of hers, that we know so much about the both of them
~~" when a woman is divorced irrevocably, she can not return to her
~~husband until she marries (including having sexual intercourse) with
~~another man." the system of divorce in islam is the most ideal system of
~~divorce ordained by any religion. the bond of marriage in islam is a
~~sacred bond which is venerated and solemnly respected. the following
~~quranic verse refers to the marriage bond "and how could ye take it when
~~ye have gone in unto each other, and they have taken from you a solemn
~~covenant ?" 63 such a bond is thus regarded with the utmost veneration.
~~islam does its utmost to make people detest divorce and urges muslims
~~not to resort to it as far as is humanly possible. the prophet muhammad,
~~blessings and peace be upon him, said "divorce is the most detested
~~permissible legitimate act in the eyes of god". PageV01P0164
# he also said "marry and do not resort to divorce, for the throne of
~~god almighty shakes with every divorce 64 in addition to discouraging
~~divorce on principle, islam ordained certain rulings that guaranteed
~~avoiding divorce except when it was the only solution to marital
~~discord. islam states that one should not resort to divorce as a result
~~of any matter that can be remedied or that might improve in the future.
~~even if a husband dislikes some qualities in his wife's nature, islam
~~does not consider this a justification for divorce. he should not
~~contemplate divorce if his feelings for his wife have undergone a change
~~or if he has begun to dislike her. any minor matters that aggravate a
~~husband in his wife's conduct-providing that this does not include
~~immorality or disobedience of the faith - are not justifiable reasons
~~for divorce, since one's emotions are fickle and inconstant. one should
~~consequently never allow oneself to be controlled by one's whims when
~~making decisions concerning important matters upon which the future of
~~one's family depends, for a person whom one dislikes today may be
~~beloved on the morrow. a husband who dislikes a certain trait in his
~~wife might discover that she possesses other qualities that appeal to
~~him. this is mentioned in the following quranic verse : "...live with
~~them on a footing of kindness and equity. if ye take a dislike to them,
~~it may be that ye dislike a thing, and god brings about through it, a
~~great deal of good". PageV01P0165
# 65 when a husband and wife fail to reconcile their differences with
~~each other, islam ordains that the matter of their discord be discussed
~~at a family meeting in which the husband and the wife are each
~~represented by a member of their families. these representatives act as
~~mediators, and it is their duty to discuss and consider the problems
~~that had caused the discord and to do their utmost to reconcile the
~~points of view of the husband and wife until a reconciliation between
~~them is effected. if all attempts at reconciliation made by the
~~mediators of both families fail, and the husband insists upon divorce,
~~that in itself signifies that the stability of the family is in danger
~~and that the chief elements upon which a marriage is founded no longer
~~exist. in such circumstances islam permits divorce and at the same time
~~guarantees the welfare and the future of the family. even if a divorce
~~takes place, islam grants the husband an opportunity to reconsider the
~~divorce if there is the slightest possibility that married life be
~~resumed. the faith of islam ordains that after a husband divorces his
~~wife once, he is given two options, one of which is to restore his wife
~~during her " iddat " or period of waiting which is approximately three
~~months for a wife who is not pregnant. the wife's return to her husband
~~in this case needs no legal procedure and is valid as soon as the
~~husband utters the words "i have restored my wife", or words to that
~~effect. PageV01P0166
# in order to encourage a husband to restore his divorced wife, islam
~~ordains that she live in her marital home during her period of waiting.
~~if a husband does not restore his wife during her period of waiting, she
~~will have been divorced for the second time. islam, which always guards
~~the welfare of the family, permits the husband after the second divorce
~~to restore his wife, but charges him with paying her a new dowry and
~~contracting a new marriage contract. in the event of the husband
~~restoring his wife during her period of waiting or marrying her for the
~~secondtime with a new marriage contract and a new dowry, and then
~~deciding to divorce her, he is permitted the same opportunities of
~~restoring his wife that he had previously been granted. after a husband
~~divorces his wife twice he is left with the right to divorce her only
~~one more time. a third divorce signifies that married life has become
~~intolerable and that the husband and wife have failed to make a success
~~of their marriage. it is at this stage that the faith of islam ordains
~~permanent divorce between them. the only chance of their remarrying is
~~if the wife marries another man after her final divorce from her first
~~husband and is divorced by her second husband. if she and her first ex-
~~husband believe that after their long separation from one another, and
~~after the change in their circumstances, they can succeed in living a
~~happily married life, islam permits them to do " islam is to be imposed
~~by force. PageV01P0167
# o mohammed said, "i have been ordered to fight with the people till
~~they say, "none has the right to be worshipped but allah, and whoever
~~says, " none has the right to be worshipped but allah , his life and
~~property will be saved by me." (otherwise it will not). vol. 4:196" this
~~hadeeth is about what it says: muslims do not fight to seize the
~~properties of non-muslims, for nationalistic reasons, for racial
~~reasons, etc.; they fight in the sake of allah. thus, when hostile non-
~~muslims, who are at war with muslims and who may have killed some
~~muslims in battle, embrace islam then muslims are required to cease all
~~hostilities and preserve the blood, property and honor of those who a
~~short while ago were fighting muslims and killing them. this is the case
~~even with those who may pretend to be muslim, because: “ ... and their
~~accounts will be with allah.” - " apostasy is punishable by death. o
~~mohammed said, "whoever changes his islamic religion, kill him." vol.
~~9:57" let us look at noble verse 3:72 "a section of the people of the
~~book (jews and christians) say: believe in the morning what is revealed
~~to the believers (muslims), but reject it at the end of the day;
~~perchance they may (themselves) turn back (from islam)." to protect
~~islam from such satanic attempts done by a group of the people of the
~~book (jews and christians), prophet mohammed peace be upon him ordered
~~the death of those who enter islam and leave it. PageV01P0168
# this temporary law that was put by our prophet had stopped the
~~hypocrites from the people of the book who carried so much hatred toward
~~islam to enter islam and desert it afterwards. noble verse 4:137 "those
~~who believe, then reject faith, then believe (again) and (again) reject
~~faith, and go on increasing in unbelief,- allah will not forgive them
~~nor guide them nor guide them on the way." notice that the quran says
~~those who reject faith and then believe and again disbelieve. if a
~~muslim rejects faith and is then killed for doing so how will he live to
~~again believe and then disbelieve. the atmosphere of this verse is that
~~of free will and freedom of choice to everyone. if allah wanted he would
~~have said something about the punishment, if there was any, of those who
~~reject islam after accepting it. but allah takes this to be clearly a
~~private matter between them and allah. certainly if the apostate is
~~hostile toward the muslims and joins the enemy in a war against them, or
~~tries to corrupt the muslims in the muslim lands by trying to convert
~~them to his/her new deviant religion, then the matter becomes different.
~~" a muslim must not be killed if he kills a non-muslim. o mohammed said,
~~" no muslim should be killed for killing a kafir" (infidel). vol. 9:50"
~~according to the qur’an, killing any person without a just cause is as
~~big a sin as killing the whole humanity and saving the life of one
~~person is as good deed as saving the whole humanity. PageV01P0169
# (see al-ma’idah: 32) muslims do not hate – let alone kill - non-
~~muslims, be they christians, jews, hindus, buddhist or followers of any
~~religion or no religion. our religion does not allow killing any

~~beings is sacrosanct according to the teachings of the qur’an and the

~~hadith you mentioned is specified in this case, there is a hadith
~~(narrated in abdul razzaq and al baihaqi) which states that muhammad
~~ordered the execution of a muslim because he killed a dhimmi (is a
~~person living in a muslim state who is a member of an officially
~~tolerated non-islamic religion. the term literally means person of the
~~dhimma, the security treaty signed with the muslim state. in both legal
~~theory and practice). ali said: "those who have our dhimma have their
~~blood equal to ours ... [they paid the jizyah so that their life and our
~~lives are equal]". moreover, omar ibn abdul aziz ordered his regional
~~governors to execute those who kill any dhimmis. " no assurance of
~~salvation. o mohammed said. "by allah, though i am the apostle of allah,
~~yet i do not know what allah will do to me." vol. 5:266" islam is a
~~religion which commands action, not just abstinence. salvation can only
~~be attained through fulfilling commands, not just by avoiding things
~~that are forbidden. PageV01P0170
# moreover, not every luxury in paradise will consist of something that
~~was forbidden in this world and is now being given as a reward. some of
~~the delights of paradise will be things that were allowed in this world,
~~such as marriage, good fruits like pomegranate and figs, etc., drinks
~~like milk and honey, and so on. all of these are permitted in this
~~world, and will be delights to be enjoyed in paradise. the bad qualities
~~of things that are forbidden in this world will not be present in their
~~heavenly forms. for example, the wine of paradise, as allaah tells us,
~~causes neither ghoul (any kind of hurt, abdominal pain, headache, sin,
~~etc.) nor intoxication (see al-saffaat 37:47). it does not rob a person
~~of his mental faculties, or cause headaches and stomachaches. it is
~~quite different from its earthly counterpart. the point i am making is
~~that the delights of paradise do not consist only of allowing things
~~that were forbidden in this world. it is also worth pointing out that
~~there are cases where abstention from prohibited things will not be
~~rewarded by being given their *****alent in the hereafter, whether those
~~prohibited things are food, drinks, deeds or words. poison, for example,
~~will not be given as a luxury in paradise, although it is forbidden in
~~this world. the same applies to sodomy, incest and other things which
~~will not be allowed in the hereafter although they are forbidden in this
~~world. this matter is quite clear, praise be to allaah. PageV01P0171
# the idea of being guaranteed paradise, and that a person's life will
~~be as horrible and unbearable as you describe if he has no such
~~guarantee, is a misconception which itself leads to the results you
~~mention. if you were to say that every person has a guarantee of
~~paradise, this would be utterly disastrous, because then everyone would
~~commit all kinds of forbidden acts, feeling safe because of this
~~guarantee. many of the crimes committed by jews and christians have been
~~done on the basis of this guarantee, with ********s of forgiveness from
~~their priests. allaah has told us about such people (interpretation of
~~the meaning): "and they say, `none shall enter paradise unless he be a
~~jew or a christian.' say, `produce your proof if you are truthful.'"
~~[al-baqarah 2:111] for us muslims, paradise is not the matter of our own
~~desires or the desires of anyone else, as allaah says (interpretation of
~~the meaning): "it will not be in accordance with your desires (muslims),
~~nor those of the people of the ******ure (jews and christians); whoever
~~works evil will have the recompense thereof, and he will not find any
~~protector or helper besides allaah." [al-nisa' 4:123] there follows a
~~brief summary of the islamic view regarding a guarantee of one's
~~destiny. islam offers a guarantee to every sincere muslim who obeys
~~allaah and remains in this state of devotion until he dies, that he will
~~definitely enter paradise. allaah says in the qur'aan (interpretation of
~~the meanings): "but those who believe and do deeds of righteousness, we
~~shall admit them to the gardens under which rivers flow (i. PageV01P0172
# e., in paradise), to dwell therein forever. allaah's promise is the
~~truth, and whose words can be truer than those of allaah? (of course,
~~none)." [al- nisa' 4:122] "allaah has promised those who believe and do
~~deeds of righteousness, that for them there is forgiveness and a great
~~reward (i.e., paradise)." [al-maa'idah 5:9] "(they will enter) `adn
~~(eden) paradise (everlasting gardens), which the most beneficent
~~(allaah) has promised to his servants in the unseen: verily, his promise
~~must come to pass." [maryam 19:61] "say: `is that (torment) better, or
~~the paradise of eternity promised to the muttaqeen (pious and righteous
~~persons)? it will be theirs as a reward and final destination." [al-
~~furqaan 25:15] "but those who fear allaah and keep their duty to their
~~lord (allaah), for them are built lofty rooms, one above another, under
~~which rivers flow (i.e., paradise). (this is) the promise of allaah, and
~~allaah does not fail in (his) promise." [al-zumar 39:20] islam also
~~guarantees the disbeliever who ignores the commands of allaah that he
~~will definitely enter hell. allaah says (interpretation of the
~~meanings): "allaah has promised the hypocrites, men and women, and the
~~disbelievers, the fire of hell, therein shall they abide. it will
~~suffice them. allaah has cursed them and for them is the lasting
~~torment." [al-tawbah 9:68] "but those who disbelieve, for them will be
~~the fire of hell. neither will it have a complete killing effect on them
~~so that they die, nor shall its torment be lightened for them.
~~PageV01P0173
# thus do we requite every disbeliever!" [faatir 35:36] allaah will say
~~to the disbelievers on the day of judgement (interpretation of the
~~meaning): "this is hell which you were promised! burn therein this day,
~~for that you used to disbelieve!" [yaa-seen 36:63-64] allaah will not go
~~back on his promise to either the believers or the disbelievers. he
~~describes how both of them will be at the end of the day of judgement
~~(interpretation of the meaning): "and the dwellers of paradise will call
~~out to the dwellers of the fire (saying): `we have indeed found true
~~what our lord had promised us; have you also found true, what your lord
~~promised (warnings, etc.)?' they shall say, `yes.' then a crier will
~~proclaim between them: `the curse of allaah is on the zaalimeen
~~(polytheists and wrongdoers, etc.)." [al-a'raaf 7:44] everyone who
~~believes and does righteous deeds, and dies in this state, will
~~definitely enter paradise. everyone who disbelieves and does evil deeds,
~~and dies in this state, will definitely enter hell. one of the great
~~guiding principles of islam is that the believer should tread a path
~~between fear and hope. he should not take it for granted that he will
~~enter paradise, because this will make him complacent, and he does not
~~know in what state he will die. nor should he assume that he is going to
~~hell, because this is despairing of the mercy of allaah, which is
~~forbidden. so the believer does righteous deeds, and hopes that allaah
~~will reward him for them, and he avoids evil deeds out of fear of the
~~punishment of allaah. PageV01P0174
# if he commits a sin, he repents in order to gain forgiveness and
~~protect himself from the punishment of hell. allaah forgives all sins
~~and accepts the repentance of those who repent. if a believer fears that
~~the good deeds he has sent on before him are not enough, as you suggest,
~~then he will increase his efforts, in fear and hope. no matter how many
~~righteous deeds he has sent on before him, he cannot rely on them and
~~take them for granted, or else he will be doomed. he keeps striving and
~~hoping for reward, and at the same time he fears lest his deeds be
~~contaminated with any element of showing off, self-admiration, or
~~anything that will lead to them being rejected by allaah. allaah
~~describes the believers (interpretation of the meaning): " ... those who
~~give that (their charity) which they give (and also do other good deeds)
~~with their hearts full of fear (whether their alms and charity, etc.)
~~have been accepted or not), because they are sure to return to their
~~lord (for reckoning)." [al-mu'minoon 23:60] so the believer keeps on
~~striving, fearing and hoping, until he meets his lord, believing in
~~tawheed (divine unity) and doing righteous deeds, and earns the pleasure
~~of his lord and paradise. if you think about the matter, you will
~~realize that these are the right motives for action, and that
~~righteousness cannot be achieved in this life in any other way " god
~~punishes a deceased if his relatives weep. o mohammed said, "the
~~deceased is punished because of the weeping of his relatives." vol.
~~2:375" islam does not neglect the practical issues of life. PageV01P0175
# crying is something which is natural in the life of every human being
~~and also accepted in the light of the shari'ah. on many occasions,
~~prophet mohammad pbuh also cried. the crying that is prohibited in
~~shari'ah is the one that entails the acts and habits of ignorant era. in
~~the era of ignorance, criers were hired to mourn for the deceased. this
~~type of crying is prohibited in the light of the shari'ah. another type
~~of crying which is also prohibited is that which leads a person to make
~~irrational statements like, 'why my son, wasn't there anyone else who
~~allah ta'ala could have taken.' also, those cries in which a person
~~screams and raises his voice are prohibited in the light of the
~~shari'ah. " urine on your clothes will bring punishment from god. o
~~mohammed said, "the deceased person is being tortured in the grave not
~~for a great thing to avoid, it is for being soiled with his urine. "
~~vol. 2:460" the right narration of the hadith is as follows : the
~~prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) once passed by two graves and
~~said: “these two persons are being tortured but not for a major sin (to
~~avoid). one of them never saved himself from being soiled with his
~~urine, while the other used to go about with calumnies (to make enmity
~~between friends). PageV01P0176
# ” what do you understand from this hadith? it is saying that he never
~~saved himself from being soiled with his urine, it`s a dirt & islam
~~calls for cleanness & purity of the body & the soul, if that person who
~~belongs to a religion passed by you, you will be discussed from him &
~~won`t come near him with the smell he has , also in our religion when we
~~pray we have to purify ourselves , clean our clothes, & make ablution
~~prior to each prayer , what if you don`t do such things & stand beside a
~~person while in prayer inside the mosque, he would annoy everyone around
~~him & they won`t be able to concentrate in prayer. the same applies to
~~the hadith you quoted : "if you eat garlic don't come to the place of
~~worship. o mohammed said, "whosoever ate from this plant (i.e. garlic)
~~should not enter the mosque." vol. 1:812"- holy war (jihad) is a
~~guarantee of heaven. o mohammed said, "the person who participates in
~~(holy battles) in allah's cause and nothing compels him to do so except
~~belief in allah and his apostle, will be recompensed by allah either
~~with a reward, or booty (if he survives) or will be admitted to paradise
~~(if he is killed). " vol. 1:35 you should understand what the word
~~"jihad" means in order to understand why the person will be rewarded for
~~: the meaning of the world "jihad" :
~~http://thetruereligion.org/modules/w...p?articleid=64 " drinking camel's
~~urine will make you healthy. o "the prophet ordered them to follow his
~~camels, and drink their milk and urine , so they followed the camels and
~~drank their milk and urine till their bodies became healthy." vol.
~~PageV01P0177
# 7:590 " before trying to mock this hadith, you should wonder how would
~~prophet mohammad pbuh 1400 years ago knew this scientific fact while he
~~was illiterate & doesn`t have modern technology that we have in the
~~modern life? it must be god the creator of humans , the creator of
~~diseases & their cure is the one who spirited this to his messenger pbuh
~~: scientists from the united arab emirates have proposed using one of
~~the world's hardiest mammals - the camel - in the campaign to fight and
~~eradicate human diseases. a team led by dr sabah jassim from the zayed
~~complex for herbal research and traditional medicine has suggested that
~~camels are highly resistant to many deadly viral diseases and their
~~antibodies could be used for new drugs. camels have a unique physiology
~~which allows them to thrive in some of the world's harshest
~~environments. but as well as these advantages, they have immune systems
~~that are so robust, they remain free from many of the viral diseases
~~that affect other mammals, such as foot-and-mouth and rinderpest. the
~~antibodies that camels carry inside them are structurally much simpler
~~than those of humans, and dr sabah jassim suggests they would be much
~~simpler to replicate artificially than human antibodies. PageV01P0178
# writing in the british institute of biology's magazine, the biologist,
~~dr jassim says the small size of camel antibodies would also allow them
~~to penetrate deep into human tissue and cells that would not be
~~otherwise accessible a researcher from a teaching hospital in the sudan
~~presented a study of 30 patients with ascites -- an accumulation of
~~serum in the abdominal cavity that causes distended stomachs -- that
~~found that they responded slightly better to 150 ml of camel urine a day
~~than to a standard medicine, the diuretic frusimide. and a chinese
~~pharmaceutical company reported that in a clinical study, its urine-
~~derived cancer drug cda-ii cured 61 percent of patients, compared with a
~~30 percent cure rate for chemotherapy. according to dr. beatrice
~~bartnett in her pamphlet, urine-therapy: it may save your life: “morning
~~urine is the richest and best urine to drink, partially due to the
~~greater level of hormonal secretion that takes place in the late night
~~hours when the body is totally relaxed and repairing itself.” let us
~~clarify the reason and story behind the pre******ion. some people had
~~become very ill at the time of the prophet, and were suffering from an
~~unknown illness. their bellies had swollen and they were not in a fit
~~state. hence, the prophet muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him)
~~said to them, that they would find a cure in the milk and urine of a
~~camel and so he sent them out to an area where camels were grazing fresh
~~herbs. these men went to this area and drank the milk and urine.
~~PageV01P0179
# sure enough, just like the prophet said, they were cured and became
~~fit and healthy. yet the prophet had said in another prophetic saying
~~that body excretions, such as blood, pus, urine, etc, was filthy and
~~prohibited in islamic law. it is islamically prohibited for a muslim to
~~drink their urine. muslim scholars came to the conclusion that the real
~~meaning of this the prophets odd pre******ion is that if a person needs
~~to consume an impure and impermissible substance as a cure for an
~~illness, and no other reasonable alternative is available, then it is
~~permissible in all other circumstances, camel urine or any animal urine
~~is prohibited. as for human urine, it is forbidden no matter what; the
~~prophet muhammad told us that it is simply waste matter, and is filthy
~~and impure (a muslim can not pray if he has any on his clothes). " a fly
~~in your drink is a cure. o mohammed said, "if a housefly falls in the
~~drink of anyone of you, he should dip it (in the drink), for one of its
~~wings has a disease and the other has the cure for the disease. " vol.
~~4:537" this is also a prove about his prophethood : medically it is well
~~known now that a fly carries some pathogens on some parts of its body as
~~mentioned by the prophet (before 1400 years. approx. when the humans
~~knew very little of modern medicine.) similarly allah created organisms
~~and other mechanisms which kill these pathogens e.g. penicillin fungus
~~kills pathogenic organisms like staphylococci and others etc.
~~PageV01P0180
# recently experiments have been done under supervision which indicate
~~that a fly carries the disease (pathogens) plus the antidote for those
~~organ-isms. ordinarily when a fly touches a liquid food it infects the
~~liquid with its pathogens, so it must be dipped in order to release also
~~the antidote for those pathogens to act as a counter balance to the
~~pathogens. regarding this subject dr. muhammad m. el-samahy chief of
~~hadith dept. in al-azhar university cairo (egypt) who has written an
~~article upon this hadith and as regards medical aspects he has mentioned
~~that the microbiologists have proved that there are longitudinal yeast
~~cells living as parasites inside the belly of the fly and these yeast
~~cells in order to repeat their life-cycle protrude through respiratory
~~tubules of the fly and if the fly is dipped in liquid, these cells burst
~~in the fluid and the ******* of those cells is an antidote for the
~~pathogens which the fly carries. " god frightens his devotees with
~~eclips. o mohammed said, "the sun and the moon are two signs amongst the
~~signs of allah and they do not eclipse because of the death of someone
~~but allah frightens his devotees with them. " vol. 2:158 " i hope that
~~you would be truthful when quoting a hadith or else you are deceiving
~~people, the right narration of the hadith : "the sun and the moon do not
~~eclipse because of someone's death or life but they are two signs
~~amongst the signs of allah, so pray whenever you see them." 21- هل يعبد
~~المسلمون الكعبة؟ 21- why do the muslims bow down to the ka'aba in their
~~prayer? PageV01P0181
# why do the muslims bow down to the ka'aba in their prayer? when islam
~~is against idol worship why do the muslims bow down to the ka'abah in
~~their prayer kabah is the cubical structure in the city of mecca, which
~~muslims face at the time of their prayers. ka'abah is the qiblah i.e.
~~the direction muslims face during their prayers. it is important to note
~~that though muslims face the ka'abah during prayers, they do not worship
~~the ka'abah. muslims worship and bow to none but allah. it is mentioned
~~in surah baqarah: "we see the turning of thy face (for guidance) to the
~~heavens: now shall we turn thee to a qiblah that shall please thee. turn
~~then thy face in the direction of the sacred mosque: wherever ye are,
~~turn your faces in that direction." [al-qur'ân 2:144] 1. islam believes
~~in fostering unity for instance, if muslims want to offer salaah
~~(prayer), it is possible that some may wish to face north, while some
~~may wish to face south. in order to unite muslims in their worship of
~~the one true god, muslims, wherever they may be, are asked to face in
~~only one direction i.e. towards the ka'abah. if some muslims live
~~towards the west of the ka'abah they face the east. similarly if they
~~live towards the east of the ka'abah they face the west. 2. ka'abah is
~~at the center of the world map the muslims were the first people to draw
~~the map of the world. they drew the map with the south facing upwards
~~and north downwards. the kaaba was at the center. later, western
~~cartographers drew the map upside down with the north facing upwards and
~~south downwards. PageV01P0182
# yet, alhamdullilah the ka'abah is at the center of the world map. 3.
~~tawaf around ka'abah for indicating one god when the muslims go to
~~masjid-e-haram in makkah, they perform tawaf or circumambulation round
~~the ka'abah. this act symbolizes the belief and worship of one god,
~~since, just as every circle has one centre, so also there is only one
~~allah (swt) worthy of worship. 4. hadith of umar (may allaah be pleased
~~with him) regarding the black stone, hajr-e-aswad, there is a hadeeth
~~(tradition), attributed to the illustrious companion of the prophet
~~muhammed (pbuh), umar (may allah be pleased with him). according to
~~sahih bukhari, volume 2, book of hajj, chapter 56, h.no. 675. umar (may
~~allah be pleased with him) said, "i know that you are a stone and can
~~neither benefit nor harm. had i not seen the prophet (pbuh) touching
~~(and kissing) you, i would never have touched (and kissed) you". 5.
~~people stood on ka'abah and gave the adhaan at the time of the prophet,
~~people even stood on the ka'abah and gave the ‘adhaan’ or the call to
~~prayer. one may ask those who allege that muslims worship the ka'abah;
~~which idol worshipper stands on the idol he worships? 6. which direction
~~is kabah? muslims try to find out which direction the kabah is, in order
~~to face while performing their prayers. yet if they were not sure which
~~direction is it then they should pray to the direction where they would
~~suppose to be the correct one. PageV01P0183
# had they been worshipping kabah itself, it would be unrealistic that
~~they would be allowed to do their prayers any way even though they are
~~not facing the correct direction of kabah. but because they worship god
~~and not the kabah, they are allowed to worship even if they did not know
~~to which direction to turn, because there will always be ... god; "it is
~~not righteousness that ye turn your faces towards east or west; but it
~~is righteousness- to believe in god and the last day, and ... " the holy
~~quran (2.177) 22- ما هو ضمان دخول الجنة في الإسلام؟ 22- warranty of
~~entering paradise in islam PageV01P0184
# warranty of entering paradise in islam this is an overview about
~~salvation in muslims' belief: islam grants every sincere to allah in
~~worship and obedience till death, a firm warranty of entering paradise .
~~in holy qur'an, allah said " but those who believe (in the oneness of
~~allah - islamic monotheism)and do deeds of righteousness, we shall admit
~~them to the gardens under which rivers flow (i.e. in paradise) to dwell
~~therein forever. allah's promise is the truth, and whose words can be
~~truer than allah ?! (of course, none)" 4:122. and said " paradise (adn
~~i.e. everlasting gardens) which the most beneficent has promised to his
~~slaves in the unseen. verily, his promise must come to pass" 19:61."
~~say: (is that better or the paradise of eternity promised to the
~~muttaqun (pious and righteous persons who fear allah much and love allah
~~much)?) it will be theirs as a reward and as a final destination"
~~25:15." but those who fear allah and keep their lord (allah), for them
~~are built lofty rooms ; one above another under which rivers flow (i.e.
~~paradise). (this is) the promise of allah, and allah does not fail in
~~his promise" 39:20. he do said. islam promised to deliver all those who
~~believe in allah and do righteous deeds. allah said " yes, but whoever
~~submits his face (himself) to allah (i.e. follows allah's religion of
~~islam monotheism)and he is a muhsin (good-doer i.e. performs good deeds
~~totally for allah's sake only without any show off or to gain praise or
~~fame, etc, and in accordance with the sunnah of muhammad) then, his
~~reward is with his lord (allah). PageV01P0185
# on such shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve." 2:112 . on the other
~~side, islam promised disbelievers and disobedients a firm lasting
~~torment in fire of hell. allah said " allah has promised the hypocrites
~~- men and women- and the disbelievers, the fire of hell, therein shall
~~they abide. it will suffice them. allah has cursed them and for them is
~~the lasting torment" 9:68 ." but those who disbelieve (in the oneness of
~~allah - islamic monotheism), for them will be the fire of hell. neither
~~it will have a complete killing effect on them so that they die, nor
~~shall its torment be lightened for them. thus do we requite every
~~disbeliever !" 35:36. said allah. and about disbelievers in the day of
~~reckoning, allah said " this is hell which you were promised ! * burn
~~therein this day, for that you used to disbelieve." 36, 37:63. so, allah
~~does not fail his promise to whomever. also, allah said about the
~~dwellers of paradise and dwellers of fire: " and the dwellers of
~~paradise will call out to the dwellers of fire (saying) : (we have
~~indeed found true what our lord had promised us; have you also found
~~true what your lord promised ?) they shall say: (yes) then a crier will
~~proclaim between them: (the curse of allah is on the zalimun
~~(polytheists and wrongdoers, etc) " 7:44. thus, everybody devotes his
~~life to faith and obedience till death, he certainly wins paradise. and
~~every disbeliever and wrongdoer died while disbelief, he must be burnt
~~into hell. PageV01P0186
# and for the wisdom and greatness of islam, mu'min (believer) should
~~spend his all life fearing allah much and hoping for his mercy, yet, he
~~never become sure of getting the paradise, as he never knows if he will
~~die while his faith, added to this, his deceiving feeling of pride and
~~glory. in the same time, he shouldn't be convinced in entering fire
~~-whatever he has done- because this is considered as a forbidden despair
~~leading to giving up the hope of allah's mercy. so, he does deeds of
~~righteousness and hopes for the reward of allah, and avoid sins fearing
~~torment, and even if he sins, he turns to allah in repentance asking for
~~forgiveness, then allah forgives all sins and verily pardons whomsoever
~~repents. and if mu'min fears that he didn't do enough good deeds, he
~~goes on increasing them with fear and hope. moreover, whatever righteous
~~deeds he has done, he should never be free of worry, neither be
~~conceited, otherwise, he will come to nothing. he just does right deeds,
~~hopes, fears, then waits and sees. but all deed must be done for god
~~sake, not for fame nor for self-interest, with no show off, no pride,
~~nor despair. about mu'mins, allah said, " and those who give that (their
~~charity)which they give (and also do other good deeds) with their heart
~~full of fear (whether their alms and charities, etc, have been accepted
~~or not) because they are sure to return to their lord (for reckoning)."
~~23:60. PageV01P0187
# in this way, mu'min stays working hard with hope and fear till he
~~meets his lord with his belief in the oneness of allah and his good
~~deeds, then he wins paradise with blessing of allah, and if you
~~scrutinized these meanings, you will find that these motives are the
~~most vital ones for hard work, and without them, rightness couldn't be
~~fulfilled. it's well known that, probability of making mistakes and
~~desire to self-determination are innate natures in human soul, and human
~~was created able to do right or wrong things as well, god has never
~~compelled him to commit sins, he gave him all the chance to make his own
~~decision, and let him free to repent and turn back to the right way. so,
~~muhammad (peace be upon him) said, "the best sinners are thoese who
~~repents more". the mercy of allah verily appears in islam when we see
~~allah calling his slaves in qur'an : " say: o 'ibadi (my slaves) who
~~have transgressed against themselves (by committing evil deeds and
~~sins)! despair not of the mercy of allah, verily allah forgives all
~~sins. truly, he is oft-forgiving, most merciful." 39:53. this is the
~~nature of human and that was the way of salvation. so, it's very
~~illogical to think that probability of making mistakes is an
~~inaccessible barrier between god and humans, and that man can never get
~~the blessing of allah, unless he sends his (false) son to be lowly
~~crucified under eyes of his father, then god forgives whole humanity.
~~it's just a silly play, and on hearing this lying story, i must deny it.
~~PageV01P0188
# one time, i have said to christian man about this story: " so you say
~~that god has sent his son to be crucified for the salvation of current
~~and coming humans, then, what is the destiny of those who died before he
~~was born? ". he just said: " our priests must have an answer to this
~~problem." nothing more. and if he had ever found, it wouldn't have been
~~more than pretense. if you studied christian belief concerning salvation
~~with an opened mind, you will find them thinking that god has sacrificed
~~his only son to expiate all humans sins, and this son is a god, this son
~~has been beaten, slapped, cursed and crucified then died !! doesn't this
~~means that god is weak and vile. it's a masked atheism. can't god
~~forgive all sins any time with one word ?! if he has the power to (and
~~they agree that too), why has he to sacrifice his son for this ? allah
~~is high exalted above all that . christian belief in expiation the
~~original sin has a negative effect on humanity. look over protestants
~~who believe that any body is required to nothing but believing in the
~~son of god who was sent to be crucified and die for expiation humanity
~~sins. so, he becomes sincere christian deserving salvation, god
~~blessing, and paradise !! further more, they believe that crucifixion
~~was for expiation humanity past, current and coming sins. so don't care
~~for the current crimes of murder, stealing and raping filling up
~~christian society, because jesus (peace be upon him) was crucified for
~~expiation them. PageV01P0189
# then, why have they to stop ?! tell me for god sake, why do you
~~imprison criminals, impose penalties and sometimes execute murderers, if
~~you think that criminals were forgiven and salvaged by means of jesus'
~~blood. 23- مفهوم العبادة في الإسلام 23- concept of worship in islam
~~concept of worship in islam bismillahi ar-rahmani ar-raheem in the name
~~of allah, the most compassionate, the most merciful the concept of
~~worship in islam is misunderstood by many people including some muslims.
~~worship is commonly taken to mean performing ritualistic acts such as
~~prayers, fasting, charity, etc. this limited understanding of worship is
~~only one part of the meaning of worship in islam. that is why the
~~traditional definition of worship in islam is a comprehensive definition
~~that includes almost everything in any individual's activities. the
~~definition goes something like this: "worship is an all inclusive term
~~for all that god loves of external and internal sayings and actions of a
~~person." in other words, worship is everything one says or does for the
~~pleasure of allah. this, of course, includes rituals as well as beliefs,
~~social activities, and personal contributions to the welfare of one's
~~fellow human-beings. islam looks at the individual as a whole. he is
~~required to submit himself completely to allah, as the quran instructed
~~prophet muhammad to do: "say (o muhammad) my prayer, my sacrifice, my
~~life and my death belong to allah; he has no partner and i am ordered to
~~be among those who submit, i.e.; muslims. PageV01P0190
# " (6:162-163) the natural result of this submission is that all one's
~~activities should conform to the instructions of the one to whom the
~~person is submitting. islam, being a way of life, requires that its
~~followers model their life according to its teachings in every aspect,
~~religious or other wise. this might sound strange to some people who
~~think of religion as a personal relation between the individual and god,
~~having no impact on one's activities outside rituals. as a matter of
~~fact islam does not think much of mere rituals when they are performed
~~mechanically and have no influence on one's inner life. the quran
~~addresses the believers and their neighbors from among the people of the
~~book who were arguing with them about the change of the direction of
~~qibla in the following verse: "it is not righteousness that you turn
~~your faces toward the east or the west, but righteous is he who believes
~~in allah and the last day and the angels and the book and the prophets,
~~and gives his beloved money to his relatives and the orphans and the
~~needy and for the ransoming of captives and who observes prayer and pays
~~the poor-due; and those who fulfill their promises when they have made
~~one, and the patient in poverty and affliction and the steadfast in time
~~of war; it is those who have proved truthful and it is those who are the
~~god-fearing." (2:177) the deeds in the above verse are the deeds of
~~righteousness and they are only a part of worship. PageV01P0191
# the prophet told us about faith, which is the basis of worship, that
~~it "is made up of sixty and some branches; the highest of which is the
~~belief in the oneness of allah, i.e., there is no god but allah and the
~~lowest in the scale of worship is removing obstacles and dirt from
~~people's way." decent work is considered in islam a type of worship. the
~~prophet said: "whoever finds himself at the nightfall tired of his work,
~~god will forgive his sins." seeking knowledge is one of the highest
~~types of worship. the prophet told his companions that "seeking
~~knowledge is a (religious) duty on every muslim." in another saying he
~~said: "seeking knowledge for one hour is better than praying for seventy
~~years." social courtesy and cooperation are part of worship when done
~~for the sake of allah as the prophet told us: "receiving your friend
~~with a smile is a type of charity, helping a person to load his animal
~~is a charity and putting some water in your neighbor's bucket is a
~~charity." it is worth noting that even performing one's duties is
~~considered a sort of worship. the prophet told us that whatever one
~~spends for his family is a type of charity; he will be rewarded for it
~~if he acquires it through legal means. kindness to members of one's
~~family is an act of worship as when one puts a piece of food in his
~~spouse's mouth. not only this but even the acts we enjoy doing very
~~much, when they are performed according to the instructions of the
~~prophet, are considered as acts of worship. PageV01P0192
# the prophet told his companions that they will be rewarded even for
~~having sexual intercourse with their wives. the companions were
~~astonished and asked: "how are we going to be rewarded for doing
~~something we enjoy very much?" the prophet asked them: "suppose you
~~satisfy your desires illegally; don't you think that you will be
~~punished for that?" they replied, "yes." "so," he said, "by satisfying
~~it legally with your wives you are rewarded for it." this means they are
~~acts of worship. thus islam does not consider sex a dirty thing that one
~~should avoid. it is dirty and sinful only when it is satisfied outside
~~marital life. ******************************************* it is clear,
~~from the previous discussion that the concept of worship in islam is a
~~comprehensive concept that includes all the positive activities of the
~~individual. this of course is in agreement with the all inclusive nature
~~of islam as a way of life. it regulates human life on all levels:
~~individual, social, economic, political and spiritual. that is why islam
~~provides guidance to the smallest details of one's life on all these
~~levels. thus following these details is following islamic instructions
~~in that specific area. it is a very encouraging element when one
~~realizes that all his activities are considered by god as acts of
~~worship. this should lead the individual to seek allah's pleasure in his
~~actions and always try to do them in the best possible manner whether he
~~is watched by his superiors or he is alone. there is always the
~~permanent supervisor, who knows everything, namely, allah. PageV01P0193
# discussing the non-ritual worship in islam first does not mean
~~undervaluing the importance of the ritual activities. actually ritual
~~worship, if performed in true spirit, elevates man morally and
~~spiritually and enables him to carry on his activities in all walks of
~~life according to the guidance of god. among ritual worships, salah
~~(ritual prayer) occupies the key position for two reasons. firstly, it
~~is the distinctive mark of a believer. secondly, it prevents an
~~individual from all sorts of abominations and vices by providing him
~~chances of direct communion with his creator five times a day, wherein
~~he renews his covenant with god and seeks his guidance again and again:
~~"you alone we worship and to you alone we turn for help. guide us to the
~~straight path." (1:5,6) actually salah is the first practical
~~manifestation of faith and also the foremost of the basis conditions for
~~the success of the believers: "successful indeed are the believers who
~~are humble in their prayers." (23:1-2) the same fact has been emphasized
~~by the prophet (pbuh) in a different way. he says: "those who offer
~~their salah (prayer) with great care and punctuality, will find it a
~~light, a proof of their faith and cause of their salvation on the day of
~~judgment." after salah, zakah (poor-due) is an important pillar of
~~islam. in the quran, salah and zakah mostly have been mentioned together
~~many times. PageV01P0194
# like salah, zakah is a manifestation of faith that affirms that god is
~~the sole owner of everything in the universe, and what men hold is a
~~trust in their hand over which god made them trustees to discharge it as
~~he has laid down: "believe in allah and his messenger and spend of that
~~over which he made you trustees." (57:7) in this respect zakah is an act
~~of devotion which, like prayer, brings the believer nearer to his lord.
~~apart from this, zakah is a mean of redistribution of wealth in a way
~~that reduces differences between classes and groups. it makes a fair
~~contribution to social stability. by purging the soul of the rich from
~~selfishness and the soul of the poor from envy and resentment against
~~society, it stops up the channels leading to class hatred and makes it
~~possible for the springs of brotherhood and solidarity to gush forth.
~~such stability is not merely based on the personal feelings of the rich;
~~it stands on a firmly established right which, if the rich denied it,
~~would be exacted by force, if necessary. siyam (fasting during the day
~~time of the month of ramadan) is another pillar of islam. the main
~~function of fasting is to make the muslim pure from "within" as other
~~aspects of shariah make him pure from "without." by such purity he
~~responds to what is true and good and shuns what is false and evil. this
~~is what we can perceive in the quranic verse: "o you who believe,
~~fasting is prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you,
~~that you may gain piety. PageV01P0195
# " (2:183) in an authentic tradition, the prophet reported allah as
~~saying: "he suspends eating, drinking, and gratification of his sexual
~~passion for my sake." thus his reward is going to be according to god's
~~great bounty. fasting, then, awakens the conscience of the individual
~~and gives it scope for exercise in a joint experience for all society at
~~the same time, thus adding further strength to each individual.
~~moreover, fasting offers a compulsory rest to the over-worked human
~~machine for the duration of one full month. similarly fasting reminds an
~~individual of those who are deprived of life's necessities throughout
~~the year or throughout life. it makes him realize the suffering of
~~others, the less fortunate brothers in islam, and thus promotes in him a
~~sense of sympathy and kindness to them. lastly, we come to al-hajj
~~(pilgrimage to the house of god in makkah). this very important pillar
~~of islam manifests a unique unity, dispelling all kinds of differences.
~~muslims from all corners of the world wearing the same dress, respond to
~~the call of hajj in one voice and language; labbaik allahumma labbaik
~~(here i am at your service o lord!). in hajj there is an exercise of
~~strict self-discipline and control where not only sacred things are
~~revered, but even the life of plants and birds is made inviolable so
~~that everything lives in safety: "and he that venerates the sacred
~~things of god, it shall be better for him with his lord." (22:30) "and
~~he that venerates the waymarks of god, it surely is from devotion of the
~~heart. PageV01P0196
# " (22:32) pilgrimage gives an opportunity to all muslims from all
~~groups, classes, organizations, and governments from all over the muslim
~~world to meet annually in a great congress. the time and venue of this
~~congress has been set by their one god. invitation to attend is open to
~~every muslim. no one has the power to bar anyone. every muslim who
~~attends is guaranteed full safety and freedom as long as he himself does
~~not violate its safety. thus, worship in islam, whether ritual or non-
~~ritual, trains the individual in such a way that he loves his creator
~~most and thereby gains an unyielding will and spirit to wipe out all
~~evil and oppression from the human society and make the word of god
~~dominant in the world.

# in brief islam is the second most popular faith in the world with over

~~islamic country. there are 6 million muslims in the usa and 3 million
~~muslims in britain, making it the second most popular faith in these two
~~countries. the bare essentials of islam over 1300 years old. began in
~~arabia. islam was revealed to humanity by the prophet muhammad (pbuh).
~~muslims believe that there is only one god, called allah. islam was
~~revealed to humanity by the prophet muhammad (pbuh). the prophet
~~muhammad (pbuh) was a human being, not a god. muslims believe that
~~muhammad (pbuh) was the last prophet of god. the word "islam" means
~~"surrender to god". the muslim ******ure is the holy qur'an. the muslim
~~building for communal worship is called a "mosque". the "five pillars of
~~islam" help muslims put their faith into action... shahadah: declaration
~~of faith. salat: ritual prayer 5 times a day. zakat: giving a fixed
~~proportion to charity. sawm: fasting. hajj: pilgrimage to mecca. there
~~are two main groups of muslims... sunni muslims make up 90% of the
~~world's muslims. the other main group are the shi'ite muslims. origins
~~islam was revealed to humanity through the prophet muhammad (pbuh)
~~during the 7th ce, in arabia, and spread rapidly through the middle
~~east. although islam was not fully revealed to us until the 7th century,
~~muslims believe that it has always existed. PageV01P0198
# everything belongs to god the word "islam" means submission to allah
~~(god), and muslims believe that everything in life should be at the
~~service of allah. as a result, muslims find it hard to accept the
~~distinction that western cultures make between a person’s religious life
~~and the rest of their life. muslims think such a distinction is entirely
~~wrong. they believe that not only individuals, but also the institutions
~~of society should serve allah. muslims submit to allah by obeying his
~~commands, and by living their whole lives in a way that is pleasing to
~~allah. muslims combine faith and action in everything they do: they
~~regard belief on its own, or good deeds on their own, as pointless. the
~~5 pillars of islam these are the five obligations that every muslim must
~~satisfy in order to live a good and responsible life according to islam.
~~******ure the islamic ******ure is the holy qur'an. muslims believe that
~~the qur'an was revealed to humanity by god through the prophet muhammad
~~(pbuh). they believe the qur'an is a perfect copy of a **** that exists
~~eternally in heaven. worship the place for communal muslim worship is
~~called a mosque muslims are required to pray 5 times a day, and although
~~this need not be at a mosque, it must be done according to precisely
~~laid down rules. muslims do not regard this requirement for ritual
~~prayer as in any way burdensome, but rejoice in the opportunity to do
~~god's bidding. PageV01P0199
# ` muslim groupings there are several different groups of muslims, but
~~all of them, in every country and community, regard their faith as a
~~bond between them, and as a major part of their identity. the largest
~~muslim group consists of sunni muslims who make up 90% of the world's
~~muslims. the other main group is the shi'ite muslims, who are
~~particularly strong in iran. source

# understanding islam and muslims what is islam ? islam is not a new
~~religion, but the same truth that god revealed through all his prophets
~~to every people. for a fifth of the world's population, islam is both a
~~religion and a complete way of life. muslims follow a religion of peace,
~~mercy, and forgiveness, and the majority have nothing to do with the
~~extremely grave events which have come to be associated with their
~~faith. who are the muslims? one billion people from a vast range of
~~races, nationalities and cultures across the globe - from the southern
~~philippines to nigeria - are united by their common islamic faith. about
~~18% live in the arab world; the world's largest muslim community is in
~~indonesia; substantial parts of asia and most of africa are muslim,
~~while significant minorities are to be found in the soviet union, china,
~~north and south america, and europe. what do muslims believe? muslims
~~believe in one, unique, incomparable god; in the angels created by him;
~~in the prophets through whom his revelations were brought to mankind; in
~~the day of judgement and individual accountability for actions; in god's
~~complete authority over human destiny and in life after death. muslims
~~believe in a chain of prophets starting with adam and including noah,
~~abraham, ishmael, isaac, jacob, joseph, job, moses, aaron, david,
~~solomon, elias, jonah, john the baptist, and jesus, peace be upon them.
~~but god's final message to man, a reconfirmation of the eternal message
~~and a summing-up of all that has gone before was revealed to the prophet
~~muhammad through gabriel. PageV01P0201
# how does someone become a muslim? simply by saying 'there is no god
~~apart from god, and muhammad is the messenger of god.' by this
~~declaration the believer announces his or her faith in all god's
~~messengers, and the ******ures they brought. what does 'islam' mean? the
~~arabic word 'islam' simply means 'submission', and derives from a word
~~meaning 'peace'. in a religious con**** it means complete submission to
~~the will of god. 'mohammedanism' is thus a misnomer because it suggests
~~that muslims worship muhammad rather than god. 'allah' is the arabic
~~name for god, which is used by arab muslims and christians alike. why
~~does islam often seem strange? islam may seem exotic or even extreme in
~~the modern world. perhaps this is because religion does not dominate
~~everyday life in the west today, whereas muslims have religion always
~~uppermost in their minds, and make no division between secular and
~~sacred. they believe that the divine law, the shari'a, should be taken
~~very seriously, which is why issues related to religion are still so
~~important 28- الإسلام ومقارنته بالديانات الأخرى 28- an open letter to
~~all non-muslims PageV01P0202
# an open letter to all non-muslims if there are any muslims that do
~~anything that is wrong we should realize that this is an individual who
~~happens to be muslim, therefore, one’s deeds are not to be attributed to
~~the religion. just as in a judeo-christian society like the united
~~states, whenever a jew or a christian perpetrates a crime it is not
~~attributed to judaism or christianity. thus, the bad that the muslims
~~may do is not to be associated with islam. since the creation of
~~humankind there has been an opposition for islam to exist in its
~~pristine purity and total completeness and the forces against it are
~~still prevalent today. frequently, we hear negative things concerning
~~muslims which are actually attempts at marring the beauty of islam. the
~~intent of this letter is to make all of its readers aware that the
~~reason for our very existence is to worship only god. so, at this point
~~it becomes fitting to mention what islam is. the exclusive objective of
~~islam is to worship only the lord of the universe- allah- known as god
~~in english. islam is a verbal –noun in arabic that literally means to
~~yield, to resign, to submit it also means to be blamelessly intact; and
~~safe and sound. the religious meaning is to believe in god and the
~~prophethood of muhammad (sallallahu alayhe wa sallam), to formally pray
~~five times daily, to annually pay a purifying alms-tax, to observe a
~~fast everyday during ramadan from dawn to sunset, to make pilgrimage to
~~makkah at least once in a lifetime ( if he has the ability to do so).
~~PageV01P0203
# everything in islam is for worship of god and only god and for none
~~other than god. consequently, one must maintain the pure and correct
~~concept of him. one must believe that god exists; that he is the sole
~~creator, owner and administrator of the universe; his unique and
~~completely perfect names and attributes are absolute without any
~~deficiencies or limitations whatsoever; and as previously stated, there
~~is none worthy of worship except him, therefore, he has exclusive
~~godship. if one does not maintain the concept, then he/she is guilty of
~~the unforgivable sin of polytheism. faithful muslims also believe in the
~~angels, the divinely-revealed ******ures, all the messengers of god, the
~~last day and the good and evil consequences of decree/predestination. it
~~is form the six above mentioned requirements of faith, particularly the
~~first one, that this letter will mention how some of the popular
~~ideologies contrast with god’s revelation which is the qur’an and the
~~authentic sunnah (exemplary practice) of the final prophet and messenger
~~muhammad, the son of abdullah. agnosticism: they question whether god,
~~angels and other spiritual beings exists or not, doubting (as atheists
~~deny) that the galaxy, air vehicles, eggs, trees, etc., are created by
~~god due to their uncertainty (denial) of his existence. this is
~~polytheism because if god didn’t do it then someone other than him had
~~to, and this is obvious falsehood because god is the sole creator of
~~everything. PageV01P0204
# judaism: they have blatantly disobeyed god, changed his revelation
~~because they didn’t like the ordinances, and murdered several of his
~~prophets, among many other heinous acts towards god. all of this reveals
~~a contempt to worship none besides god because they put their desires,
~~whims and caprice before his word. zoroastrianism: their god, ahura
~~mazda, shares his sovereignty with an opposing god, angra mainyu. this
~~belief denies god as the sole owner of the universe, thereby, denying
~~part of his lordship. hinduism: their supreme being brahma forms a
~~trinity with vishnu and shiva (as christians do with jesus and the holy
~~spirit), thereby, negating god as the sole godhead and lord. [excerpts

# believe it or not: you were born muslim! believe it or not: you were
~~born muslim! what would you call a religion whose beliefs, practices and
~~followers are being bashed and bad-mouthed in practically every sphere
~~of activity, in almost every corner of the globe, yet it attracts ever-
~~increasing numbers of people? a paradox? a miracle ? or simply, the
~~truth: islaam. the fact that islaam is the fastest growing religion in
~~the world today, is proof that our creator has taken it upon himself to
~~perfect the truth that he sent all his prophets and messengers with --
~~from aadam [as] to muhammad [saw]. studies conducted in the west show
~~that the sheer number of new muslims is changing the demographic profile
~~of countries all over the world, and not all of them are born into
~~muslim families. with some 6 million adherents in the united states,
~~islam is said to be the nation’s fastest-growing religion. one expert
~~estimates that 25,000 people a year become muslims in this country; some
~~clerics say they have seen conversion rates quadruple since sept 11.
~~ironically for a religion that is routinely bashed for “subjugating” and
~~“oppressing” its female followers, the number of female reverts to
~~islaam outnumber the males 4:1! the fact that more and more people are
~~finding their way to islaam, notwithstanding the relentless propaganda,
~~deliberate misinformation and outright prejudice against it, never
~~ceases to amaze me. PageV01P0206
# how do these people navigate in the darkness to find the light of
~~islaam in spite of all the obstacles in the way? the answer is that our
~~creator has granted each one of us a guiding light -- a pure, undefiled
~~innate nature called the fitrah. unlike christians who believe in the
~~doctrine of original sin and assert that each baby is born tainted with
~~the sin of adam’s disobedience to god, muslims believe that every child
~~is born into a state of purity where it recognizes its creator and is
~~naturally subservient to his laws. in his book the fundamentals of
~~islaamic monotheism, abu ameenah bilaal philips writes: just as a
~~child’s body submits to the physical laws which allaah has put in
~~nature, its soul also submits naturally to the fact that allaah is its
~~lord and creator. but its parents try to make it follow their own way
~~and the child is not strong enough in the early stages of its life to
~~resist or oppose its parents. the religion which the child follows at
~~this stage is one of custom and upbringing and allaah does not hold it
~~to account for this religion. when the child matures in youth and clear
~~proofs of the falsehood of its religion are brought to it, the adult
~~must now follow the religion of knowledge and reason. at this point the
~~devils try their best to encourage him to stay as he is or to go further
~~astray. evils are made pleasing to him and he must now live in the midst
~~of a struggle between his innate pure nature and his desires in order to
~~find the right road. PageV01P0207
# if he chooses to follow his innate nature, his fitrah, allaah will
~~help him overcome his desires even though it may take most of his life
~~to escape, for many people enter islaam in their old age. the qur’aan
~~also points to this phenomenon, where every soul that has been created
~~is asked who their lord is, and they testify that it is none other than
~~allaah before they are born into the world. when your lord drew forth
~~from the loins of the children of aadam their descendants and made them
~~testify concerning themselves. saying: am i not your lord? they said:
~~“yes, we testify to it.” (this) in case you say on the day of judgement,
~~“we were unaware of this.” or in case you say: it was our ancestors who
~~made partners (with allaah) and we are only their descendants ... [surah
~~al-a’raaf 7:172-173] explaining this verse, the prophet [saw] said: when
~~allaah created aadam [as] , he took a covenant from him ... then he
~~extracted from him all of his descendants who would be born until the
~~end of the world, generation after generation and spread them out in
~~front of him in order to take a covenant from them. he spoke to them
~~face to face saying: am i not your lord? and they all replied: yes, we
~~testify to it. allaah then explained why he had all of mankind bear
~~witness that he was their creator and the only true god worthy of
~~worship. he said: that was in case you (mankind) should say on the day
~~of resurrection, “surely we were unaware of all this. we had no idea
~~that you were our god. PageV01P0208
# ” [silsilah al ahadeeth as saheehah, narrated by ibn abbaas, collected
~~by imaam ahmad] this is the reason why people who adopt islaam are said
~~to revert instead of convert, because they are going back to their
~~original nature -- the one they were naturally created with -- which is
~~automatically aligned with the universe, its creator and his laws; as
~~opposed to simply exchanging one set of beliefs for another. reverts to
~~islaam testify that this inner inclination to search for the truth, to
~~know and follow it is a major factor in their adopting the faith. it is
~~interesting to see some of the reasons cited by reverts for adopting
~~islaam: islaamic monotheism “the christian sect of athanasians
~~insistently inculcates the tenet that christianity is based on a belief
~~in three gods (trinity), that a slightest doubt as to this belief will
~~lead one to immediate perdition; and that a person who wishes to attain
~~salvation in this world and the next should definitely hold a belief in
~~the three gods: god, the son of god, and the holy ghost. when i became a
~~muslim, i received a letter, which said: “by becoming a muslim you have
~~damned yourself to perdition. no one can save you. for you deny the
~~divinity of god.” the poor man [who wrote that letter] thought that i no
~~longer believed in god, not knowing that when jesus had begun to preach,
~~he stated the unity of god and he never claimed to be his son. [lord
~~headley al-farooq; british diplomat, engineer] an answer for every
~~question: “i would always search for causes and purposes for everything.
~~PageV01P0209
# i would anticipate logical explanations for them. on the other hand,
~~the explanations provided by priests and other christian men of religion
~~did not satisfy me. most of the time, instead of giving satisfactory
~~answers to my questions, they would dismiss the matter with evasive
~~prevarications such as, “we cannot understand these things. they are
~~divine secrets” and “they are beyond the grasp of the human mind.” upon
~~this i decided to study, on the one hand, oriental religions, and on the
~~other hand, books written by famous philosophers. the books written by
~~these philosophers always dealt with such subjects as protoplasms,
~~atoms, molecules, and particles, and did not even touch on reflections
~~such as “what becomes of the human soul?” “where does the soul go after
~~death?” “how should we discipline our souls in this world?” the islamic
~~religion, on the other hand, treated the human subject not only within
~~the corporeal areas, but also along the spiritual extensions. therefore,
~~i chose islam not because i had lost my way, or only because
~~christianity had incurred my displeasure, or as a result of sudden
~~decision, but, on the contrary, after very minutely studying it and
~~becoming thoroughly convinced about its greatness, singularity,
~~solemnity and perfection [muhammad alexander russell webb; american
~~diplomat, author] direct relationship with one’s creator: now i realize
~~i can get in direct contact with god, unlike christianity or any other
~~religion. as one hindu lady told me, “you don't understand the hindus.
~~PageV01P0210
# we believe in one god; we use these objects (idols) to merely
~~concentrate.” what she was saying was that in order to reach god, one
~~has to create associates, that are idols for the purpose. but islam
~~removes all these barriers. [yusuf islaam, formerly cat stevens]
~~universality: islam is a religion that belongs not only to the arabs but
~~to the entire humanity. this universal quality presents a sharp contrast
~~with the judaic religion, whose holy book always refers to the god of
~~israel. one more thing that i love in islam is that this religion
~~recognizes all the prophets, makes no distinction between them and
~~treats the believers of other religions with compassion. [mahmud gunnar
~~ahmad, swedish muslim] absolute equality before god, extended
~~brotherhood: there were tens of thousands of pilgrims, from all over the
~~world. they were of all colors, from blue-eyed blondes to black-skinned
~~africans. but we were all participating in the same ritual, displaying a
~~spirit of unity and brotherhood that my experiences in america had led

# you may be shocked by these words coming from me. but on this

# [letter written from makkah, by malcolm x] purity of prayer: if i were
~~asked what impressed me most in the religion of islam, i would probably
~~say the prayers, because prayers in christianity are used wholly in
~~begging god (through jesus christ) to grant worldly favours, whereas in
~~islam they ar used to give praise and thanks to almighty god for all his
~~blessings since he knows what is necessary for our welfare and grants us
~~what we need without our asking it. [cecilia mahmuda cannolly,

~~picked on polygamy. at last i thought i had something; obviously western
~~monogamy was an improvement on this old system. i talked of it to my
~~muslim friend. he illustrated with the aid of newspaper articles how
~~much true monogamy there was in england, and convinced me that a limited
~~polygamy was the answer to the secret unions that are becoming so
~~distressingly common in the west. my own common sense could see that,
~~particularly after a war, when women of a certain age group far
~~outnumber men, a percentage of them are destined to remain spinsters.
~~did god give them life for that? i recollect that on the radio programme
~~known as `dear sir' an unmarried english girl had called for lawful
~~polygamy, saying she would prefer a shared married life rather than the
~~loneliness to which she seemed to be destined. PageV01P0213

~~سؤال : لماذا المسلمون يؤمنون بالقضاء والقدر 31- misconception: islam is
~~fatalistic PageV01P0215
# source: islamic awareness article id : msc010008 [4560] misconception:
~~islam is fatalistic most muslims find it rather odd that their religion,
~~which strikes a beautiful balance between faith and action, could be
~~accused of being "fatalistic". perhaps this misconception came about
~~because muslims are taught to say "praise be to god!" whenever anything
~~good or bad happens. this is because muslims know that everything comes
~~from almighty god, who is the all-knowing sustainer of the universe, and
~~that since a muslim should rely completely on god, whatever happened
~~must have been for the better. however, this does not mean that muslims
~~are not taught to take action in life --- just the opposite is true.
~~islam requires not only faith, but action --- such as regular prayer,
~~fasting and charity. to be more precise, in islam actions are part of
~~one's faith. islam total rejects the extreme beliefs of some religions
~~that teach that you shouldn't go to a doctor when sick, but only pray
~~for god to heal you. islam's outlook is very positive, since it teaches
~~that human beings can take positive action in this life. this was
~~certainly what was taught by prophet muhammad, peace be upon him, to his
~~followers --- since they obviously took the action of spreading islam
~~from spain to morocco in a very short period of time. even though islam
~~teaches that god knows what human beings will do before they do it,
~~human beings still have free will. PageV01P0216
# certainly god, who is all-knowing and all-wise, knows what is going to
~~happen to everyone before it happens -- to deny this would be a denial
~~of god himself. however, if human-beings did not have free will, it
~~would be ridiculous and un-just for god to demand that they do certain
~~things and believe certain things. far from being "fatalistic", islam
~~teaches that a human-being's main purpose in life is to be god-
~~conscious. due to this, muslims worry less about material matters and
~~view their earthly life in a proper perspective. this is due to the fact
~~that islam clearly teaches that if people worship and depend on almighty
~~god alone, then they have nothing to worry about - since god wants what
~~is best for them. true freedom, from the islamic perspective, does not
~~mean aimlessly following all of your human desires for food, drink,
~~wealth and sex. on the contrary, freedom means being able to control
~~one's base desires and fulfilling them in a proper and legal way. this
~~brings one's desires in tune with what god wants for us - only then is a
~~person truly free! 32- رد على شبهة (الإسلام دين فقط للعرب) 32-

# misconception: islam is a religion only for arabs source: islamic
~~awareness article id : msc010003 [4410] ===================
~~misconception: islam is a religion only for arabs the fastest way to
~~prove that this is completely false is to state the fact that only about
~~15% to 20% of the muslims in the world are arabs. there are more indian
~~muslims than arab muslims, and more indonesian muslims than indian
~~muslims! believing that islam is only a religion for arabs is a myth
~~that was spread by the enemies of islam early in its history. this
~~mistaken assumption is possibly based on the fact that most of the first
~~generation of muslims were arabs, the qur'an is in arabic and the
~~prophet muhammad was an arab. however, both the teachings of islam and
~~the history of its spread show that the early muslims made every effort
~~to spread their message of truth to all nations, races and peoples.
~~furthermore, it should be clarified that not all arabs are muslims and
~~not all muslims are arabs. an arab can be a muslim, christian, jew,
~~atheist - or of any other religion or ideology. also, many countries
~~that some people consider to be "arab" are not "arab" at all -- such as
~~turkey and iran (persia). the people who live in these countries speak
~~languages other than arabic as their native tongues and are of a
~~different ethnic heritage than the arabs. PageV01P0218
# it is important to realize that from the very beginning of the mission
~~of prophet muhammad, peace be upon him, his followers came from a wide
~~spectrum of individuals -- there was bilal, the african slave; suhaib,
~~the byzantine roman; ibn sailam, the jewish rabbi; and salman, the
~~persian. since religious truth is eternal and unchanging, and mankind is
~~one universal brotherhood, islam teaches that almighty god's revelations
~~to mankind have always been consistent, clear and universal. the truth
~~of islam is meant for all people regardless of race, nationality or
~~linguistic background. taking a look at the muslim world, from nigeria
~~to bosnia and from malaysia to afghanistan is enough to prove that islam
~~is a universal message for all of mankind --- not to mention the fact
~~that significant numbers of europeans and americans of all races and
~~ethnic backgrounds are coming into islam. 33- نظرة الإسلام للعبودية
~~(الإسلام حرر العبيد) 33- slavery & islam PageV01P0219
# slavery & islam slavery is a very old practice that was gradually
~~abolished in islam (submission). many people out of ignorance or out of
~~biased attack islam (submission) for its stand on slavery, distorting
~~and misrepresenting the true stand of islam (submission). in this
~~article we will see the great humane position of islam on slavery. the
~~central issue of slavery and equality is the concept of human dignity.
~~in islam, god has conferred honor and dignity on all human beings
~~irrespective of their race, gender, age, social status and beliefs. in
~~(17:70) god says, “we have honored the children of adam, and provided
~~them with rides on land and in the sea. we provided for them good
~~provisions, and we gave them greater advantages than many of our
~~creatures.” together with human dignity and honor comes freedom to live,
~~the right to be respected on an equal basis before the law and to enjoy
~~equal social treatment. islam (submission) stresses the equality of
~~mankind as god created man from a common source and the only allegiance
~~and obedience is to god, the almighty creator. islam has never condoned
~~any form of discrimination. the only thing that sets men apart is their
~~righteousness. [49:13] "o people, we created you from the same male and
~~female, and rendered you distinct peoples and tribes, that you may
~~recognize one another. the best among you in the sight of god is the
~~most righteous. god is omniscient, cognizant. PageV01P0220
# " slavery has been gradually abolished by islam, it did not come by
~~decree or injunction but rather in the form of total management
~~principles which were applied during the early periods of islam and
~~still applicable today if necessary. slavery has long been practiced
~~before the coming of islam (submission). in the pre-islamic egyptian,
~~jewish, greek and roman societies , slavery was in full use in different
~~aspects. aristotle subscribed to the idea that men were born not to be
~~equal as some will become master due to their superior brain power and
~~intellectual capacity while others will become slaves. the approach
~~taken by islam (submission) is full of wisdom and at the same time
~~provides a package of pro-active measures to eliminate this practice. it
~~is a gradual but effective approach which combines several affirmative
~~measures. the main strategy is: to narrow down the sources of slavery
~~with a view to eliminating it all-together; and opening a wide avenue
~~for slaves to gain independence. people became slaves because of
~~criminal actions, unpaid debts, gambling, kidnapping, piracy,
~~irresponsible parents who sold their children into slavery, being
~~descendants of slaves, prisoners of war and voluntary submission to be a
~~slave in order to get out from the miseries of life such as acute
~~poverty. these were effectively reduced by islam. the provision of
~~slavery through wars was no longer important after the islamic
~~civilization redefined the mode of interaction between nations -- from
~~power struggle to peaceful and productive coexistence. PageV01P0221
# indirectly but effectively islam has closed this source of slavery.
~~islam (submission) opened all the doors to free the slaves by setting up
~~rules which greatly facilitated the emancipation of slaves: the
~~initiative of islam in promoting independence for slaves was carried out
~~in the following ways: (1) encouraging the masters and the muslim
~~societies at large to help in freeing the slaves. the act of freeing the
~~slave is considered a noble one which is highly valued by god. the
~~slaves themselves entered into an agreement with the master to buy their
~~independence by paying certain amounts of money. the society was
~~encouraged to help in providing the freedom money. [24:33] “those who
~~cannot afford to get married shall maintain morality until god provides
~~for them from his grace. those among your servants who wish to be freed
~~in order to marry, you shall grant them their wish, once you realize
~~that they are honest. and give them from god's money that he has
~~bestowed upon you. ... ... ... ” (2) making the act of freeing the slave
~~a part of punishment for any criminal act as well as for non-conformity
~~of the islamic rituals. there are several verses in the holy quran which
~~specifically mentioned the requirement of freeing the slave as a way of
~~meeting the punishment for wrongdoing. see 4:92, 5:89 and 58:3 (3) using
~~charity money as a financial source to free the slave. [9:60] charities
~~shall go to the poor, the needy, the workers who collect them, the new
~~converts, to free the slaves, to those burdened by sudden expenses, in
~~the cause of god, and to the traveling alien. PageV01P0222
# such is god's commandment. god is omniscient, most wise. [2:177]
~~“righteousness is not turning your faces towards the east or the west.
~~righteous are those who believe in god, the last day, the angels, the
~~******ure, and the prophets; and they give the money, cheerfully, to the
~~relatives, the orphans, the needy, the traveling alien, the beggars, and
~~to free the slaves; and they observe the contact prayers (salat) and
~~give the obligatory charity (zakat); and they keep their word whenever
~~they make a promise; and they steadfastly persevere in the face of
~~persecution, hardship, and war. these are the truthful; these are the
~~righteous.” [90:10-13] did we not show him the two paths? he should
~~choose the difficult path. which one is the difficult path? the freeing
~~of slaves. finally we can say that islam found the slavery system
~~already existing and put forward a plan to abolish it. no slaves or free
~~the slaves: some people question why god in the quran did not prohibit
~~slavery and instead commanded and rewarded the freeing of the slaves.
~~god, the almighty, knows that slavery is a social disease that will
~~persist as long as humans are present on earth. if the order in the
~~quran is to prohibit slavery, it would be a noble command but since only
~~the believers in the quran would be the ones following the quran, the
~~command would not help slavery outside islam (submission.) every muslim
~~would then free his slaves and remind the other muslims not to have
~~slaves any more and their duty stop at that. PageV01P0223
# the command in the quran to free the slaves, does not stop at the
~~muslims or islam but extend to all the slaves wherever they are. a
~~muslim (submitter) would therefore free any slaves he might have had and
~~after that turns to any other slaves in any location and of any religion
~~to free, as commanded by god in the quran. in other words, the command
~~to free the slaves is far more reaching and far more effective than the
~~mere order to stop having slaves. van denburg, a non-muslim historian
~~says, "many regulations have been made by islam, showing how noble was
~~the feeling of the prophet muhammad and his followers towards slaves. in
~~those regulations, we find that the merits of islam are contrary to all
~~the systems used until recently by nations, who claim to be most
~~civilized and developed." islam never became a force nor a party that
~~promoted and condoned slavery. a balanced analysis of this issue would
~~recognize the wisdom of islam in managing the heinous practice of
~~slavery and effectively putting an end to it. 34- 50 علامة من علامات

# islamic art by elisabeth siddiqui an introduction to islamic art art
~~is the mirror of a culture and its world view. there is no case to which
~~this statement more directly applies than to the art of the islamic
~~world. not only does its art reflect its cultural values, but even more
~~importantly, the way in which its adherents, the muslims, view the
~~spiritual realm, the universe, life, and the relationship of the parts
~~to the whole. for the muslim, reality begins with and centers around god
~~("allah" in arabic), the one, the unique, the sovereign, the holy, the
~~almighty, the all-knowing, the loving, the most merciful. all existence
~~is subject to his will and his laws. he is the center of conscious
~~muslims' worship and aspirations, the focus of their lives. since the
~~command and authority are one, all things are bound together under god's
~~lordship as parts of an all-encompassing divine scheme, which includes
~~all aspects of being and life -- whatever is both inside and outside of
~~time and space, and embracing both the macrocosm in its most awesome
~~manifestations and the microcosm in its most minute forms. god creates
~~and sustains his creation how and as he wills, and all affairs return to
~~him for ultimate decision and judgment. with such a belief system, the
~~muslim is convinced of the balance and harmony of all things in
~~existence, even when there appear to be confusing contradictions and
~~imbalances, regarding these as the reflection of man's limited
~~understanding and knowledge. PageV01P0228
# nothing is looked upon as occurring randomly or by chance, for all is
~~part of the plan of the all-wise, most merciful planner. one of the
~~vital beliefs of the muslim is that the totality of things, all good and
~~evil, proceed from the lord of all being. because of the strict
~~injunctions against such depictions of humans or animals which might
~~result in idol-worship, islamic art developed a unique character,
~~utilizing a number of primary forms: geometric, arabesque, floral, and
~~calligraphic, which are often interwoven. from early times, muslim art
~~has reflected this balanced, harmonious world-view.
~~________________________________________ the islamic view of the cosmos
~~in the islamic view, god is the ultimate reality. all things in the
~~visible creation emanate from him and are manifestations of his divine
~~names or attributes (sifat). he created the cosmos, both what is known
~~to man and what is unknown, and he is the sustainer of all things, with
~~everything turning to him and centered upon him. this is evident in the
~~very structure of atoms . the early muslim artists and artisans who
~~derived the intricate systems of interconnected geometric forms which
~~constitute the bases of islamic geometric art of course had no idea of
~~such realities. nonetheless, the graphic manner in which they conceived
~~god's supreme central place in the cosmos, and the connection of the
~~parts of creation to him and to the whole, reflects a very significant
~~approximation of what can now be ********ed by science. PageV01P0229
# ________________________________________ the tradition of fine
~~craftsmanship throughout the history of islam, its art has taken a great
~~variety of forms in the different parts of the muslim world, which
~~stretches from north africa to southeast asia, according to local
~~customs and conditions, ranging from unsophisticated folk art to that of
~~the most skilled artist or artisan. in the works of the latter, whether
~~it be a master calligrapher, a renowned ceramists or potter, a skilled
~~embroiderer or miniature-maker, the legacy of fine craftsmanship,
~~involving the mastery of an art or craft along traditional lines
~~complete with meticulous attention to fine detail, is characteristic.
~~these traditions persist today, and islamic architecture and decorative
~~arts are still very much alive and valued in many parts of the muslim
~~world. while western-style art forms and machine work have to an extent
~~eroded the traditional forms, nonetheless, handwork is respected and
~~loved, an important aspect of the decoration of mosques and muslim
~~homes. in particular, decoration featuring qur'anic calligraphy is an
~~important aspect of islamic art.
~~________________________________________ the ageless legacy of arabic
~~calligraphy arabic is the language of islam. it is the language of its
~~prophet, muhammad; the language in which the holy qur'an, islam's sacred
~~******ure, was revealed to him by god; the language of muslims' worship;
~~and the language which binds muslims of all times and places together in
~~a single cohesive brotherhood. PageV01P0230
# because of muslims' profound respect and love for the qur'an, the art
~~of calligraphy was developed among them from early times to a very high
~~degree. throughout the muslim world, qur'anic verses embellish mosques,
~~palaces and homes, businesses, and, in some places, public areas. often
~~the calligraphy is done in conjunction with decorative motifs, lovingly
~~embellishing what is most sacred and precious. due to its peculiar
~~character, the arabic ****** lends itself wonderfully to decorative use.
~~over the centuries, many different ******s have evolved in various
~~regions of the muslim world. arabic is read from right to left, with an
~~alphabet of twenty-six letters, of which three are long vowels. short
~~vowels are indicated by small symbols above or under the letters
~~themselves. ________________________________________ "god is beautiful
~~and loves beauty" -- so said the prophet of islam some 1400 years ago.
~~he also said, "god likes that when you do anything, you do it
~~excellently." such prophetic sayings (hadiths) have provided the impetus
~~for muslims' embellishment and beautification of their places of
~~worship, homes, and even of articles in common use in everyday life. the
~~emphasis in islamic art is on ornamentation rather than on art for art's
~~sake; while the names of the producers of the finest works of islamic
~~art may not have survived, their works have become prototypes and models
~~on which other artists and craftsmen patterned their works, or from
~~which they derived the impetus for related work. PageV01P0231
# an example of this is a small pouch embellished with cross-stitch
~~embroidery and ornamented with coins. the pouch holds a small unseen
~~bottle, which jordanian bedouin women used to hold kohl, a natural
~~eyeliner. but in keeping with the muslim tradition of ornamenting
~~utilitarian articles, a very ordinary brown glass bottle has been given
~~a place of honor in a beautifully embroidered work of decorative art.
~~such arts as embroidery and fine crocheting were commonplace skills
~~among muslim women in the past -- and still are in some places in the
~~muslim world -- as each growing girl and her mother worked in periods of
~~spare time during the years before the girl's marriage to produce a set
~~of finely hand-worked bed linens, towels, prayer rugs, quilt,
~~tablecloths, and the like for the bride to take to her new home. today,
~~the finest arts, including rugs, are to be found in turkey, iran, syria,
~~pakistan, india, egypt and morocco, where the legacy of islamic arts
~~remains alive and strong. 36- مساهمة المسلمين في العلوم 36- muslims

~~moon and the sun are of vital importance in the daily life of every
~~muslim. by the moon, muslims determine the beginning and the end of the
~~months in their lunar calendar. by the sun the muslims calculate the
~~times for prayer and fasting. it is also by means of astronomy that
~~muslims can determine the precise direction of the qiblah, to face the
~~ka'bah in makkah, during prayer. the most precise solar calendar,
~~superior to the julian, is the jilali, devised under the supervision of
~~umar khayyam. the qur'an contains many references to astronomy. "the
~~heavens and the earth were ordered rightly, and were made subservient to
~~man, including the sun, the moon, the stars, and day and night. every
~~heavenly body moves in an orbit assigned to it by god and never
~~digresses, making the universe an orderly cosmos whose life and
~~existence, diminution and expansion, are totally determined by the
~~creator." [qur'an 30:22] these references, and the injunctions to learn,
~~inspired the early muslim scholars to study the heavens. they integrated
~~the earlier works of the indians, persians and greeks into a new
~~synthesis. ptolemy's almagest (the title as we know it is arabic) was
~~translated, studied and criticized. many new stars were discovered, as
~~we see in their arabic names - algol, deneb, betelgeuse, rigel,
~~aldebaran. PageV01P0233
# astronomical tables were compiled, among them the toledan tables,
~~which were used by copernicus, tycho brahe and kepler. also compiled
~~were almanacs - another arabic term. other terms from arabic are zenith,
~~nadir, albedo, azimuth. muslim astronomers were the first to establish
~~observatories, like the one built at mugharah by hulagu, the son of
~~genghis khan, in persia, and they invented instruments such as the
~~quadrant and astrolabe, which led to advances not only in astronomy but
~~in oceanic navigation, contributing to the european age of exploration.
~~geography: muslim scholars paid great attention to geography. in fact,
~~the muslims' great concern for geography originated with their religion.
~~the qur'an encourages people to travel throughout the earth to see god's
~~signs and patterns everywhere. islam also requires each muslim to have
~~at least enough knowledge of geography to know the direction of the
~~qiblah (the position of the ka'bah in makkah) in order to pray five
~~times a day. muslims were also used to taking long journeys to conduct
~~trade as well as to make the hajj and spread their religion. the far-
~~flung islamic empire enabled scholar-explorers to compile large amounts
~~of geographical and climatic information from the atlantic to the
~~pacific. among the most famous names in the field of geography, even in
~~the west, are ibn khaldun and ibn batuta, renowned for their written
~~accounts of their extensive explorations. PageV01P0234
# in 1166, al-idrisi, the well-known muslim scholar who served the
~~sicilian court, produced very accurate maps, including a world map with
~~all the continents and their mountains, rivers and famous cities. al-
~~muqdishi was the first geographer to produce accurate maps in color. it
~~was, moreover, with the help of muslim navigators and their inventions
~~that magellan was able to traverse the cape of good hope, and da gama
~~and columbus had muslim navigators on board their ships. humanity:
~~seeking knowledge is obligatory in islam for every muslim, man and
~~woman. the main sources of islam, the qur'an and the sunnah (prophet
~~muhammad's traditions), encourage muslims to seek knowledge and be
~~scholars, since this is the best way for people to know allah (god), to
~~appreciate his wondrous creations and be thankful for them. muslims were
~~therefore eager to seek knowledge, both religious and secular, and
~~within a few years of muhammad's mission, a great civilization sprang up
~~and flourished. the outcome is shown in the spread of islamic
~~universities; al-zaytunah in tunis, and al-azhar in cairo go back more
~~than 1,000 years and are the oldest existing universities in the world.
~~indeed, they were the models for the first european universities, such
~~as bologna, heidelberg, and the sorbonne. even the familiar academic cap
~~and gown originated at al-azhar university. muslims made great advances
~~in many different fields, such as geography, physics, chemistry,
~~mathematics, medicine, pharmacology, architecture, linguistics and
~~astronomy. PageV01P0235
# algebra and the arabic numerals were introduced to the world by muslim
~~scholars. the astrolabe, the quadrant, and other navigational devices
~~and maps were developed by muslim scholars and played an important role
~~in world progress, most notably in europe's age of exploration. muslim
~~scholars studied the ancient civilations from greece and rome to china
~~and india. the works of aristotle, ptolemy, euclid and others were
~~translated into arabic. muslim scholars and scientists then added their
~~own creative ideas, discoveries and inventions, and finally transmitted
~~this new knowledge to europe, leading directly to the renaissance. many
~~scientific and medical treatises, having been translated into latin,
~~were standard **** and reference books as late as the 17th and 18th
~~centuries. mathematics: it is interesting to note that islam so strongly
~~urges mankind to study and explore the universe. for example, the holy
~~qur'an states: "we (allah) will show you (mankind) our signs/patterns in
~~the horizons/universe and in yourselves until you are convinced that the
~~revelation is the truth." [qur'an, 14:53] this invitation to explore and
~~search made muslims interested in astronomy, mathematics, chemistry, and
~~the other sciences, and they had a very clear and firm understanding of
~~the correspondences among geometry, mathematics, and astronomy. the
~~muslims invented the symbol for zero (the word "cipher" comes from
~~arabic sifr), and they organized the numbers into the decimal system -
~~base 10. additionally, they invented the symbol to express an unknown
~~quantity, i.e. variables like x. PageV01P0236
# the first great muslim mathematician, al-khawarizmi, invented the
~~subject of algebra (al-jabr), which was further developed by others,
~~most notably umar khayyam. al-khawarizmi's work, in latin translation,
~~brought the arabic numerals along with the mathematics to europe,
~~through spain. the word "algorithm" is derived from his name. muslim
~~mathematicians excelled also in geometry, as can be seen in their
~~graphic arts, and it was the great al-biruni (who excelled also in the
~~fields of natural history, even geology and mineralogy) who established
~~trigonometry as a distinct branch of mathematics. other muslim
~~mathematicians made significant progress in number theory. • medicine:
~~in islam, the human body is a source of appreciation, as it is created
~~by almighty allah (god). how it functions, how to keep it clean and
~~safe, how to prevent diseases from attacking it or cure those diseases,
~~have been important issues for muslims. prophet muhammad himself urged
~~people to "take medicines for your diseases", as people at that time
~~were reluctant to do so. he also said: "god created no illness, but
~~established for it a cure, except for old age. when the antidote is
~~applied, the patient will recover with the permission of god." this was
~~strong motivation to encourage muslim scientists to explore, develop,
~~and apply empirical laws. much attention was given to medicine and
~~public health care. the first hospital was built in baghdad in 706 ac.
~~the muslims also used camel caravans as mobile hospitals, which moved
~~from place to place. PageV01P0237
# since the religion did not forbid it, muslim scholars used human
~~cadavers to study anatomy and physiology and to help their students
~~understand how the body functions. this empirical study enabled surgery
~~to develop very quickly. al-razi, known in the west as rhazes, the
~~famous physician and scientist, (d. 932) was one of the greatest
~~physicians in the world in the middle ages. he stressed empirical
~~observation and clinical medicine and was unrivaled as a diagnostician.
~~he also wrote a treatise on hygiene in hospitals. khalaf abul-qasim al-
~~zahrawi was a very famous surgeon in the eleventh century, known in
~~europe for his work, concessio (kitab al-tasrif). ibn sina (d. 1037),
~~better known to the west as avicenna, was perhaps the greatest physician
~~until the modern era. his famous book, al-qanun fi al-tibb, remained a
~~standard ****book even in europe, for over 700 years. ibn sina's work is
~~still studied and built upon in the east. other significant
~~contributions were made in pharmacology, such as ibn sina's kitab al-
~~shifa' (book of healing), and in public health. every major city in the
~~islamic world had a number of excellent hospitals, some of them teaching
~~hospitals, and many of them were specialized for particular diseases,
~~including mental and emotional. the ottomans were particularly noted for
~~their building of hospitals and for the high level of hygiene practiced
~~in them. definition: the word islam has a two-fold meaning: peace, and
~~submission to god. this submission requires a fully conscious and
~~willing effort to submit to the one almighty god. PageV01P0238
# one must consciously and conscientiously give oneself to the service
~~of allah. this means to act on what allah enjoins all of us to do (in
~~the qur'an) and what his beloved prophet, muhammad (pbuh) encouraged us
~~to do in his sunnah (his lifestyle and sayings personifying the qur'an).
~~once we humble ourselves, rid ourselves of our egoism and submit totally
~~to allah, and to him exclusively, in faith and in action, we will surely
~~feel peace in our hearts. establishing peace in our hearts will bring
~~about peace in our external conduct as well. islam is careful to remind
~~us that it not a religion to be paid mere lip service; rather it is an
~~all-encompassing way of life that must be practiced continuously for it
~~to be islam. the muslim must practice the five pillars of the religion:
~~the declaration of faith in the oneness of allah and the prophet hood of
~~muhammad (pbuh), prayer, fasting the month of ramadan, alms-tax, and the
~~pilgrimage to makkah; and believe in the six articles of faith: belief
~~in god, the holy books, the prophets, the angels, the day of judgment
~~and god's decree, whether for good or ill. there are other injunctions
~~and commandments which concern virtually all facets of one's personal,
~~family and civic life. these include such matters as diet, clothing,
~~personal hygiene, interpersonal relations, business ethics,
~~responsibilities towards parents, spouse and children, marriage, divorce
~~and inheritance, civil and criminal law, fighting in defense of islam,
~~relations with non-muslims, and so much more. 1- محمد نبي الله (صلى

# 1- muhammed the prophet of god muhammed the prophet of god adapted
~~from: http://www.usc.edu/dept/msa/ and http://www.islam-guide.com/ much
~~has been written about the prophet muhammad (sallallahu alaihi wa salaam
~~- "peace be upon him"), from in-depth biographies by muslim scholars and
~~non-muslim researchers to sayings upon sayings of others. muhammad ibn
~~abdullah was born in mecca in the year 569 ce. since his father died
~~before his birth and his mother died shortly thereafter, he was raised
~~by his uncle who was from the respected tribe of quraysh. he was
~~illiterate, unable to read or write, and remained so till his death. as
~~he grew up, he became known as truthful, honest, trustworthy, generous,
~~and sincere. he earned his living as a trader and was known by his
~~people as "al-amin," the trustworthy one. muhammad was very religious,
~~and he had always detested the decadence and idolatry of his society. at
~~the age of forty, muhammad received his first revelation from god/allah
~~through the angel gabriel. the revelations continued for twenty-three
~~years, and they are collectively known as the quran. he began denounce
~~the idolatry of the arabic society and to preach islam which calls for
~~faith in only one god, who is the only one worthy of worship. muhammad
~~was first ordered to instruct his immediate family on islam, but
~~eventually it was revealed to him that he should begin delivering the
~~message to all of mankind. in the next 20 years of his life, he
~~communicated the message of allah to his people, and set an example for
~~how each human being should lead his or her life. PageV01P0240
# this is especially valuable since muhammad is the last prophet of
~~allah. as soon as he began to recite the quran and to preach the truth
~~which god had revealed to him, he and his small group of followers
~~suffered persecution from unbelievers. the persecution grew so fierce
~~that in the year 622 god gave them the command to emigrate. this
~~emigration from makkah to the city of madinah, some 260 miles to the
~~north, marks the beginning of the muslim calendar. after several years,
~~muhammad and his followers were able to return to makkah, where they
~~forgave their enemies. before muhammad died, the greater part of the
~~arabian peninsula had become muslim, and within a century of his death,
~~islam had spread to spain in the west and as far east as china. the
~~prophet muhammad was a perfect example of an honest, just, merciful,
~~compassionate, truthful, and brave human being. though he was a man, he
~~was far removed from all evil characteristics and strove solely for the
~~sake of god and his reward in the hereafter. in all his actions and
~~dealings, he was ever mindful and fearful of god. if we compare the life
~~of muhammad before his mission as a prophet and his life after he began
~~his mission as a prophet, we will conclude that it is beyond reason to
~~think that muhammad was a false prophet, who claimed prophethood to
~~attain material gains, greatness, glory, or power. before his mission as
~~a prophet, muhammad had no financial worries. as a successful and
~~reputed merchant, muhammad drew a satisfactory and comfortable income.
~~PageV01P0241
# after his mission as a prophet and because of it, he became worse off
~~materially. as aisha, muhammad’s wife, reported, the prophet’s household
~~would sometimes pass two months without lighting a fire to **** a meal,
~~surviving only on dates and water, and camel milk given to them as a
~~gift by their neighbors. she said the simple bed on which the prophet
~~slept was merely a "mattress made of leather stuffed with the fiber of
~~the date-palm tree.” sahl ibn sa’ad, one of muhammad’s companions, said,
~~“the prophet of allah did not see bread made from fine flour from the
~~time allah sent him (as a prophet) until he died.” amr ibn al-hareth,
~~one of muhammad’s companions, said that when the prophet died, he left
~~neither money nor anything else except his white riding mule, his arms,
~~and a piece of land which he left to charity. muhammad lived this hard
~~life till he died although the muslim treasury was at his disposal, the
~~greater part of the arabian peninsula was muslim before he died, and the
~~muslims were victorious after eighteen years of his mission. also,
~~despite his responsibilities as a prophet, a teacher, a statesman, and a
~~judge, muhammad used to milk his goat, mend his clothes, repair his
~~shoes, help with the household work, and visit poor people when they got
~~sick. he also helped his companions with the physical labor of digging a
~~trench around their city. his life was an amazing model of simplicity
~~and humbleness. muhammad’s followers loved him, respected him, and
~~trusted him to an amazing extent. PageV01P0242
# yet he continued to emphasize that deification should be directed to
~~god and not to him personally. anas, one of muhammad’s companions, said
~~that there was no person whom they loved more than the prophet muhammad
~~, yet when he came to them, they did not stand up for him because he
~~hated their standing up for him, as other people do with their great
~~people. long before there was any prospect of success for islam and at
~~the outset of a long and painful era of torture, suffering, and
~~persecution of muhammad and his followers, he received an interesting
~~offer. an envoy of the pagan leaders, otba, came to him saying, “...if
~~you want money, we will collect enough money for you so that you will be
~~the richest one of us. if you want leadership, we will take you as our
~~leader and never decide on any matter without your approval. if you want
~~a kingdom, we will crown you king over us...” only one concession was
~~required from muhammad in return for that, to give up calling people to
~~islam and worshipping god alone without any partner. PageV01P0243
# wouldn’t this offer be tempting to one pursuing worldly benefit? was
~~muhammad hesitant when the offer was made? did he turn it down as a
~~bargaining strategy leaving the door open for a better offer? the
~~following was his answer: {in the name of god, the most gracious, the
~~most merciful} and he recited to otba the verses of the quran 41:1-38:
~~{a revelation from (god), the most gracious, the most merciful; a book
~~whereof the verses are explained in detail; a quran in arabic, for
~~people who know, giving good news and warning, yet most of them turn
~~away, so they do not listen...} (quran, 41:2-4) on another occasion and
~~in response to his uncle’s plea to stop calling people to islam,
~~muhammad’s answer was as decisive and sincere: {i swear by the name of
~~god, o uncle, that if they place the sun in my right-hand and the moon
~~in my left-hand in return for giving up this matter (calling people to
~~islam), i will never desist until either god makes it triumph or i
~~perish defending it.} finally in the year 632 at the age of sixty-three,
~~muhammad died a natural death in the beloved city to which he and his
~~followers had emigrated, madinah, al-munawarah. some examples of the
~~prophet muhammad’s sayings: "the believers, in their love, mercy, and
~~kindness to one another are like a body: if any part of it is ill, the
~~whole body shares its sleeplessness and fever." [muslim and bukhari]
~~"the most perfect of the believers in faith are the best of them in
~~morals. and the best among them are those who are best to their wives.
~~PageV01P0244
# " [ahmad] "none of you believes (completely) until he loves for his
~~brother what he loves for himself." [muslim and bukhari] "the merciful
~~are shown mercy by the all-merciful. show mercy to those on earth, and
~~god will show mercy to you." [at-tirmithi and abu dawud] "smiling at
~~your brother is charity..." [at-tirmithi] "a good word is charity."
~~[muslim and bukhari] "whoever believes in god and the last day (the day
~~of judgment) should do good to his neighbor." [muslim and bukhari] "god
~~does not judge you according to your appearance and your wealth, but he
~~looks at your hearts and looks into your deeds." [muslim] "pay the
~~worker his wage before his sweat dries." [ibn majah] "a man walking
~~along a path felt very thirsty. reaching a well, he descended into it,
~~drank his fill, and came up. then he saw a dog with its tongue hanging
~~out, trying to lick up mud to quench its thirst. the man said, 'this dog
~~is feeling the same thirst that i felt.' so he went down into the well
~~again, filled his shoe with water, and gave the dog a drink. so, god
~~thanked him and forgave his sins." the prophet was asked, "messenger of
~~god, are we rewarded for kindness towards animals?" he said: "there is a
~~reward for kindness to every living animal or human." [muslim and

~~http://www.islamicity.com/mosque/seerah.htm in the desert of arabia was
~~mohammad born, according to muslim historians, on april 20, 571. the
~~name means highly praised. he is to me the greatest mind among all the
~~sons of arabia. he means so much more than all the poets and kings that
~~preceded him in that impenetrable desert of red sand. when he appeared
~~arabia was a desert -- a nothing. out of nothing a new world was
~~fashioned by the mighty spirit of mohammad -- a new life, a new culture,
~~a new civilization, a new kingdom which extended from morocco to indies
~~and influenced the thought and life of three continents -- asia, africa
~~and europe. when i thought of writing on mohammad the prophet, i was a
~~bit hesitant because it was to write about a religion i do not profess
~~and it is a delicate matter to do so for there are many persons
~~professing various religions and belonging to diverse school of thought
~~and denominations even in same religion. though it is sometimes, claimed
~~that religion is entirely personal yet it can not be gain-said that it
~~has a tendency to envelop the whole universe seen as well unseen. it
~~somehow permeates something or other our hearts, our souls, our minds
~~their conscious as well as subconscious and unconscious levels too.
~~PageV01P0246
# the problem assumes overwhelming importance when there is a deep
~~conviction that our past, present and future all hang by the soft
~~delicate, tender silked cord. if we further happen to be highly
~~sensitive, the center of gravity is very likely to be always in a state
~~of extreme tension. looked at from this point of view, the less said
~~about other religion the better. let our religions be deeply hidden and
~~embedded in the resistance of our innermost hearts fortified by unbroken
~~seals on our lips. but there is another aspect of this problem. man
~~lives in society. our lives are bound with the lives of others willingly
~~or unwillingly, directly or indirectly. we eat the food grown in the
~~same soil, drink water, from the same the same spring and breathe the
~~same air. even while staunchly holding our own views, it would be
~~helpful, if we try to adjust ourselves to our surroundings, if we also
~~know to some extent, how the mind our neighbor moves and what the main
~~springs of his actions are. from this angle of vision it is highly
~~desirable that one should try to know all religions of the world, in the
~~proper sprit, to promote mutual understanding and better appreciation of
~~our neighborhood, immediate and remote. further, our thoughts are not
~~scattered as appear to be on the surface. they have got themselves
~~crystallized around a few nuclei in the form of great world religions
~~and living faiths that guide and motivate the lives of millions that
~~inhabit this earth of ours. PageV01P0247
# it is our duty, in one sense if we have the ideal of ever becoming a
~~citizen of the world before us, to make a little attempt to know the
~~great religions and system of philosophy that have ruled mankind. in
~~spite of these preliminary remarks, the ground in these field of
~~religion, where there is often a conflict between intellect and emotion
~~is so slippery that one is constantly reminded of fools that rush in
~~where angels fear to tread. it is also not so complex from another point
~~of view. the subject of my writing is about the tenets of a religion
~~which is historic and its prophet who is also a historic personality.
~~even a hostile critic like sir william muir speaking about the holy
~~quran says that. "there is probably in the world no other book which has
~~remained twelve centuries with so pure ****." i may also add prophet
~~mohammad is also a historic personality, every event of whose life has
~~been most carefully recorded and even the minutest details preserved
~~intact for the posterity. his life and works are not wrapped in mystery.
~~my work today is further lightened because those days are fast
~~disappearing when islam was highly misrepresented by some of its critics
~~for reasons political and otherwise. prof. bevan writes in cambridge
~~medieval history, "those account of mohammad and islam which were
~~published in europe before the beginning of 19th century are now to be
~~regarded as literary curiosities. PageV01P0248
# " my problem is to write this monograph is easier because we are now
~~generally not fed on this kind of history and much time need be spent on
~~pointing out our misrepresentation of islam. the theory of islam and
~~sword for instance is not heard now frequently in any quarter worth the
~~name. the principle of islam that there is no compulsion in religion is
~~well known. gibbon, a historian of world repute says, "a pernicious
~~tenet has been imputed to mohammadans, the duty of extirpating all the
~~religions by sword." this charge based on ignorance and bigotry, says
~~the eminent historian, is refuted by quran, by history of muslem
~~conquerors and by their public and legal toleration of christian
~~worship. the great success of mohammad's life had been effected by sheer
~~moral force, without a stroke of sword. but in pure self-defense, after
~~repeated efforts of conciliation had utterly failed, circumstances
~~dragged him into the battlefield. but the prophet of islam changed the
~~whole strategy of the battlefield. the total number of casualties in all
~~the wars that took place during his lifetime when the whole arabian
~~peninsula came under his banner, does not exceed a few hundreds in all.
~~but even on the battlefield he taught the arab barbarians to pray, to
~~pray not individually, but in congregation to god the almighty. during
~~the dust and storm of warfare whenever the time for prayer came, and it
~~comes five times a every day, the congregation prayer had not to be
~~postponed even on the battlefield. PageV01P0249
# a party had to be engaged in bowing their heads before god while other
~~was engaged with the enemy. after finishing the prayers, the two parties
~~had to exchange their positions. to the arabs, who would fight for forty
~~years on the slight provocation that a camel belonging to the guest of
~~one tribe had strayed into the grazing land belonging to other tribe and
~~both sides had fought till they lost 70,000 lives in all; threatening
~~the extinction of both the tribes to such furious arabs, the prophet of
~~islam taught self-control and discipline to the extent of praying even
~~on the battlefield. in an aged of barbarism, the battlefield itself was
~~humanized and strict instructions were issued not to cheat, not to break
~~trust, not to mutilate, not to kill a child or woman or an old man, not
~~to hew down date palm nor burn it, not to cut a fruit tree, not to
~~molest any person engaged in worship. his own treatment with his
~~bitterest enemies is the noblest example for his followers. at the
~~conquest of mecca, he stood at the zenith of his power. the city which
~~had refused to listen to his mission, which had tortured him and his
~~followers, which had driven him and his people into exile and which had
~~unrelentingly persecuted and boycotted him even when he had taken refuge
~~in a place more than 200 miles away, that city now lay at his feet. by
~~the laws of war he could have justly avenged all the cruelties inflicted
~~on him and his people. PageV01P0250
# but what treatment did he accord to them? mohammad's heart flowed with
~~affection and he declared, "this day, there is no reproof against you
~~and you are all free." "this day" he proclaimed, "i trample under my
~~feet all distinctions between man and man, all hatred between man and
~~man." this was one of the chief objects why he permitted war in self
~~defense, that is to unite human beings. and when once this object was
~~achieved, even his worst enemies were pardoned. even those who killed
~~his beloved uncle, hamazah, mangled his body, ripped it open, even
~~chewed a piece of his liver. the principles of universal brotherhood and
~~doctrine of the equality of mankind which he proclaimed represents one
~~very great contribution of mohammad to the social uplift of humanity.
~~all great religions have preached the same doctrine but the prophet of
~~islam had put this theory into actual practice and its value will be
~~fully recognized, perhaps centuries hence, when international
~~consciousness being awakened, racial prejudices may disappear and
~~greater brotherhood of humanity come into existence. miss. sarojini
~~naidu speaking about this aspect of islam says, "it was the first
~~religion that preached and practiced democracy; for in the mosque, when
~~the minaret is sounded and the worshipers are gathered together, the
~~democracy of islam is embodied five times a day when the peasant and the
~~king kneel side by side and proclaim, god alone is great." the great
~~poetess of india continues, "i have been struck over and over again by
~~this indivisible unity of islam that makes a man instinctively a
~~brother. PageV01P0251
# when you meet an egyptian, an algerian and indian and a turk in
~~london, it matters not that egypt is the motherland of one and india is
~~the motherland of another." mahatma gandhi, in his inimitable style,
~~says "some one has said that europeans in south africa dread the advent
~~islam -- islam that civilized spain, islam that took the torch light to
~~morocco and preached to the world the gospel of brotherhood. the
~~europeans of south africa dread the advent of islam. they may claim
~~equality with the white races. they may well dread it, if brotherhood is
~~a sin. if it is equality of colored races then their dread is well
~~founded." every year, during the hajj, the world witnesses the wonderful
~~spectacle of this international exhibition of islam in leveling all
~~distinctions of race, color and rank. not only the europeans, the
~~african, the arabian, the persian, the indians, the chinese all meet
~~together in medina as members of one divine family, but they are clad in
~~one dress every person in two simple pieces of white seamless cloth, one
~~piece round the loin the other piece over the shoulders, bare head
~~without pomp or ceremony, repeating "here am i o god; at thy command;
~~thou art one and alone; here am i." thus there remains nothing to
~~differentiate the high from the low and every pilgrim carries home the
~~impression of the international significance of islam. in the opinion of
~~prof. hurgronje "the league of nations founded by prophet of islam put
~~the principle of international unity of human brotherhood on such
~~universal foundations as to show candle to other nations. PageV01P0252
# " in the words of same professor "the fact is that no nation of the
~~world can show a parallel to what islam has done the realization of the
~~idea of the league of nations." the prophet of islam brought the reign
~~of democracy in its best form. the caliph caliph ali and the son in-law
~~of the prophet, the caliph mansur, abbas, the son of caliph mamun and
~~many other caliphs and kings had to appear before the judge as ordinary
~~men in islamic courts. even today we all know how the black were treated
~~by the civilized white races. consider the state of bilal, a black
~~slave, in the days of the prophet of islam nearly 14 centuries ago. the
~~office of calling muslims to prayer was considered to be of status in
~~the early days of islam and it was offered to this slave. after the
~~conquest of mecca, the prophet ordered him to call for prayer and the
~~slave, with his black color and his thick lips, stood over the roof of
~~the holy mosque at mecca called the ka'ba the most historic and the
~~holiest mosque in the islamic world, when some proud arabs painfully
~~cried loud, "oh, this black slave, woe be to him. he stands on the roof
~~of holy ka'ba to call for prayer." at that moment, the prophet announced
~~to the world, this verse of the holy quran for the first time. "o
~~mankind, surely we have created you, families and tribes, so you may
~~know one another. surely, the most honorable of you with god is most
~~righteous among you. surely, god is knowing, aware. PageV01P0253
# " and these words of the holy quran created such a mighty
~~transformation that the caliph of islam, the purest of arabs by birth,
~~offered their daughter in marriage to this slave, and whenever, the
~~second caliph of islam, known to history as umar the great, the
~~commander of faithful, saw this slave, he immediately stood in reverence
~~and welcomed him by "here come our master; here come our lord." what a
~~tremendous change was brought by quran in the arabs, the proudest people
~~at that time on the earth. this is the reason why goethe, the greatest
~~of german poets, speaking about the holy quran declared that, "this book
~~will go on exercising through all ages a most potent influence." this is
~~also the reason why george bernard shaw says, "if any religion has a
~~chance or ruling over england, say, europe, within the next 100 years,
~~it is islam". it is this same democratic spirit of islam that
~~emancipated women from the bondage of man. sir charles edward archibald
~~hamilton says "islam teaches the inherent sinlessness of man. it teaches
~~that man and woman and woman have come from the same essence, posses the
~~same soul and have been equipped with equal capabilities for
~~intellectual, spiritual and moral attainments. " the arabs had a very
~~strong tradition that one who can smite with the spear and can wield the
~~sword would inherit. but islam came as the defender of the weaker sex
~~and entitled women to share the inheritance of their parents.
~~PageV01P0254
# it gave women, centuries ago right of owning property, yet it was only
~~12 centuries later , in 1881, that england, supposed to be the cradle of
~~democracy adopted this institution of islam and the act was called "the
~~married woman act", but centuries earlier, the prophet of islam had
~~proclaimed that "woman are twin halves of men. the rights of women are
~~sacred. see that women maintained rights granted to them." islam is not
~~directly concerned with political and economic systems, but indirectly
~~and in so far as political and economic affairs influence man's conduct,
~~it does lay down some very important principles to govern economic life.
~~according to prof. massignon, it maintains the balance between
~~exaggerated opposites and has always in view the building of character
~~which is the basis of civilization. this is secured by its law of
~~inheritance, by an organized system of charity known as zakat, and by
~~regarding as illegal all anti-social practices in the economic field
~~like monopoly, usury, securing of predetermined unearned income and
~~increments, cornering markets, creating monopolies, creating an
~~artificial scarcity of any commodity in order to force the prices to
~~rise. gambling is illegal. contribution to schools, to places of
~~worship, hospitals, digging of wells, opening of orphanages are highest
~~acts of virtue. orphanages have sprung for the first time, it is said,
~~under the teaching of the prophet of islam. the world owes its
~~orphanages to this prophet born an orphan. "good all this" says carlyle
~~about mohammad. PageV01P0255
# "the natural voice of humanity, of pity and equity, dwelling in the
~~heart of this wild son of nature, speaks." a historian once said a great
~~man should be judged by three tests: was he found to be of true metel by
~~his contemporaries ? was he great enough to raise above the standards of
~~his age ? did he leave anything as permanent legacy to the world at
~~large ? this list may be further extended but all these three tests of
~~greatness are eminently satisfied to the highest degree in case of
~~prophet mohammad. some illustrations of the last two have already been
~~mentioned. the first is: was the prophet of islam found to be of true
~~metel by his contemporaries? historical records show that all the
~~contemporaries of mohammad both friends foes, acknowledged the sterling
~~qualities, the spotless honesty, the noble virtues, the absolute
~~sincerity and every trustworthiness of the apostle of islam in all walks
~~of life and in every sphere of human activity. even the jews and those
~~who did not believe in his message, adopted him as the arbiter in their
~~personal disputes by virtue of his perfect impartiality. even those who
~~did not believe in his message were forced to say "o mohammad, we do not
~~call you a liar, but we deny him who has given you a book and inspired
~~you with a message." they thought he was one possessed. they tried
~~violence to cure him. but the best of them saw that a new light had
~~dawned on him and they hastened him to seek the enlightenment.
~~PageV01P0256
# it is a notable feature in the history of prophet of islam that his
~~nearest relation, his beloved cousin and his bosom friends, who know him
~~most intimately, were not thoroughly imbued with the truth of his
~~mission and were convinced of the genuineness of his divine inspiration.
~~if these men and women, noble, intelligent, educated and intimately
~~acquainted with his private life had perceived the slightest signs of
~~deception, fraud, earthliness, or lack of faith in him, mohammad's moral
~~hope of regeneration, spiritual awakening, and social reform would all
~~have been foredoomed to a failure and whole edifice would have crumbled
~~to pieces in a moment. on the contrary, we find that devotion of his
~~followers was such that he was voluntarily acknowledged as dictator of
~~their lives. they braved for him persecutions and danger; they trusted,
~~obeyed and honored him even in the most excruciating torture and
~~severest mental agony caused by excommunication even unto death. would
~~this have been so, had they noticed the slightest backsliding in their
~~master? read the history of the early converts to islam, and every heart
~~would melt at the sight of the brutal treatment of innocent muslim men
~~and women. sumayya, an innocent women, is cruelly torn into pieces with
~~spears. an example is made of "yassir whose legs are tied to two camels
~~and the beast were are driven in opposite directions", khabbab bin arth
~~is made lie down on the bed of burning coal with the brutal legs of
~~their merciless tyrant on his breast so that he may not move and this
~~makes even the fat beneath his skin melt. PageV01P0257
# "khabban bin adi is put to death in a cruel manner by mutilation and
~~cutting off his flesh piece-meal." in the midst of his tortures, being
~~asked weather he did not wish mohammad in his place while he was in his
~~house with his family, the sufferer cried out that he was gladly
~~prepared to sacrifice himself his family and children and why was it
~~that these sons and daughters of islam not only surrendered to their
~~prophet their allegiance but also made a gift of their hearts and souls
~~to their master? is not the intense faith and conviction on part of
~~immediate followers of mohammad, the noblest testimony to his sincerity
~~and to his utter self-absorption in his appointed task? and these men
~~were not of low station or inferior mental caliber. around him in quite
~~early days, gathered what was best and noblest in mecca, its flower and
~~cream, men of position, rank, wealth and culture, and from his own kith
~~and kin, those who knew all about his life. all the first four caliphs,
~~with their towering personalities, were converts of this period. the
~~encyclopedia britannica says that "mohammad is the most successful of
~~all prophets and religious personalities" . but the success was not the
~~result of mere accident. it was not a hit of fortune. it was a
~~recognition of fact that he was found to be true ****l by his
~~contemporaries. it was the result of his admirable and all compelling
~~personality. the personality of mohammad! it is most difficult to get
~~into the truth of it. only a glimpse of it i can catch. what a dramatic
~~succession of picturesque scenes. PageV01P0258
# there is mohammad the prophet, there is mohammad the general; mohammad
~~the king; mohammad the warrior; mohammad the businessman; mohammad the
~~preacher; mohammad the philosopher; mohammad the statesman; mohammad the
~~orator; mohammad the reformer; mohammad the refuge of orphans; mohammad
~~the protector of slaves; mohammad the emancipator of women; mohammad the
~~law-giver; mohammad the judge; mohammad the saint. and in all these
~~magnificent roles, in all these departments of human activities, he is
~~like, a hero.. orphanhood is extreme of helplessness and his life upon
~~this earth began with it; kingship is the height of the material power
~~and it ended with it. from an orphan boy to a persecuted refugee and
~~then to an overlord, spiritual as well as temporal, of a whole nation
~~and arbiter of its destinies, with all its trials and temptations, with
~~all its vicissitudes and changes, its lights and shades, its up and
~~downs, its terror and splendor, he has stood the fire of the world and
~~came out unscathed to serve as a model in every face of life. his
~~achievements are not limited to one aspect of life, but cover the whole
~~field of human conditions. if for instance, greatness consist in the
~~purification of a nation, steeped in barbarism and immersed in absolute
~~moral darkness, that dynamic personality who has transformed, refined
~~and uplifted an entire nation, sunk low as the arabs were, and made them
~~the torch-bearer of civilization and learning, has every claim to
~~greatness. PageV01P0259
# if greatness lies in unifying the discordant elements of society by
~~ties of brotherhood and charity, the prophet of the desert has got every
~~title to this distinction. if greatness consists in reforming those
~~warped in degrading and blind superstition and pernicious practices of
~~every kind, the prophet of islam has wiped out superstitions and
~~irrational fear from the hearts of millions. if it lies in displaying
~~high morals, mohammad has been admitted by friend and foe as al amin, or
~~the faithful. if a conqueror is a great man, here is a person who rose
~~from helpless orphan and an humble creature to be the ruler of arabia,
~~the equal to chosroes and caesars, one who founded great empire that has
~~survived all these 14 centuries. if the devotion that a leader commands
~~is the criterion of greatness, the prophet's name even today exerts a
~~magic charm over millions of souls, spread all over the world. he had
~~not studied philosophy in the school of athens of rome, persia, india,
~~or china. yet, he could proclaim the highest truths of eternal value to
~~mankind. illiterate himself, he could yet speak with an eloquence and
~~fervor which moved men to tears, to tears of ecstasy. born an orphan
~~blessed with no worldly goods, he was loved by all. he had studied at no
~~military academy; yet he could organize his forces against tremendous
~~odds and gained victories through the moral forces which he marshaled.
~~gifted men with genius for preaching are rare. descartes included the
~~perfect preacher among the rarest kind in the world. hitler in his mein
~~kamp has expressed a similar view. PageV01P0260
# he says "a great theorist is seldom a great leader. an agitator is
~~more likely to posses these qualities. he will always be a great leader.
~~for leadership means ability to move masses of men. the talents to
~~produce ideas has nothing in common with capacity for leadership." "but"
~~, he says, "the union of theorists, organizer and leader in one man, is
~~the rarest phenomenon on this earth; therein consists greatness." in the
~~person of the prophet of islam the world has seen this rarest phenomenon
~~walking on the earth, walking in flesh and blood. and more wonderful
~~still is what the reverend bosworth smith remarks, "head of the state as
~~well as the church, he was caesar and pope in one; but, he was pope
~~without the pope's claims, and caesar without the legions of caesar,
~~without an standing army, without a bodyguard, without a palace, without
~~a fixed revenue. if ever any man had the right to say that he ruled by a
~~right divine it was mohammad, for he had all the power without
~~instruments and without its support. he cared not for dressing of power.
~~the simplicity of his private life was in keeping with his public life."
~~after the fall of mecca, more than one million square miles of land lay
~~at his feet, lord of arabia, he mended his own shoes and coarse woolen
~~garments, milked the goats, swept the hearth, kindled the fire and
~~attended the other menial offices of the family. the entire town of
~~medina where he lived grew wealthy in the later days of his life.
~~PageV01P0261
# everywhere there was gold and silver in plenty and yet in those days
~~of prosperity many weeks would elapse without a fire being kindled in
~~the hearth of the king of arabia, his food being dates and water. his
~~family would go hungry many nights successively because they could not
~~get anything to eat in the evening. he slept on no soften bed but on a
~~palm mat, after a long busy day to spend most of his night in prayer,
~~often bursting with tears before his creator to grant him strength to
~~discharge his duties. as the reports go, his voice would get choked with
~~weeping and it would appear as if a *****ng pot was on fire and boiling
~~had commenced. on the very day of his death his only assets were few
~~coins a part of which went to satisfy a debt and rest was given to a
~~needy person who came to his house for charity. the clothes in which he
~~breathed his last had many patches. the house from where light had
~~spread to the world was in darkness because there was no oil in the
~~lamp. circumstances changed, but the prophet of god did not. in victory
~~or in defeat, in power or in adversity, in affluence or in indigence, he
~~is the same man, disclosed the same character. like all the ways and
~~laws of god, prophets of god are unchangeable. an honest man, as the
~~saying goes, is the noblest work of god, mohammad was more than honest.
~~he was human to the marrow of his bones. human sympathy, human love was
~~the music of his soul. to serve man, to elevate man, to purify man, to
~~educate man, in a word to humanize man-this was the object of his
~~mission, the be-all and end all of his life. PageV01P0262
# in thought, in word, in action he had the good of humanity as his sole
~~inspiration, his sole guiding principle. he was most unostentatious and
~~selfless to the core. what were the titles he assumed? only true servant
~~of god and his messenger. servant first, and then a messenger. a
~~messenger and prophet like many other prophets in every part of the
~~world, some known to you, many not known you. if one does not believe in
~~any of these truths one ceases to be a muslim. it is an article of
~~faith. "looking at the circumstances of the time and unbounded reverence
~~of his followers" says a western writer "the most miraculous thing about
~~mohammad is, that he never claimed the power of working miracles."
~~miracles were performed but not to propagate his faith and were
~~attributed entirely to god and his inscrutable ways. he would plainly
~~say that he was a man like others. he had no treasures of earth or
~~heaven. nor did he claim to know the secrets of that lie in womb of
~~future. all this was in an age when miracles were supposed to be
~~ordinary occurrences, at the back and call of the commonest saint, when
~~the whole atmosphere was surcharged with supernaturalism in arabia and
~~outside arabia. he turned the attention of his followers towards the
~~study of nature and its laws, to understand them and appreciate the
~~glory of god. the quran says, "god did not create the heavens and the
~~earth and all that is between them in play. he did not create them all
~~but with the truth. but most men do not know." the world is not
~~illusion, nor without purpose. it has been created with the truth.
~~PageV01P0263
# the number of verses inviting close observation of nature are several
~~times more than those that relate to prayer, fasting, pilgrimage etc.
~~all put together. the muslim under its influence began to observe nature
~~closely and this give birth to the scientific spirit of the observation
~~and experiment which was unknown to the greeks. while the muslim
~~botanist ibn baitar wrote on botany after collecting plants from all
~~parts of the world, described by myer in his gesch. der botanikaa-s, a
~~monument of industry, while al byruni traveled for forty years to
~~collect mineralogical specimens, and muslim astronomers made some
~~observations extending even over twelve years. aristotle wrote on
~~physics without performing a single experiment, wrote on natural
~~history, carelessly stating without taking the trouble to ascertain the
~~most verifiable fact that men have more teeth than animal. galen, the
~~greatest authority on classical anatomy informed that the lower jaw
~~consists of two bones, a statement which is accepted unchallenged for
~~centuries till abdul lateef takes the trouble to examine a human
~~skeleton. after enumerating several such instances, robert priffault
~~concludes in his well known book the making of humanity, "the debt of
~~our science to the arabs does not consist in starting discovers or
~~revolutionary theories. science owes a great more to arabs culture; it
~~owes is existence. PageV01P0264
# " the same writer says "the greeks systematized, generalized and
~~theorized but patient ways of investigation, the accumulation of
~~positive knowledge, the minute methods of science, detailed and
~~prolonged observation, experimental inquiry, were altogether alien to
~~greek temperament. what we call science arose in europe as result of new
~~methods of investigation, of the method of experiment, observation,
~~measurement, of the development of mathematics in form unknown to the
~~greeks. that spirit and these methods, concludes the same author, were
~~introduced into the european world by arabs." it is the same practical
~~character of the teaching of prophet mohammad that gave birth to the
~~scientific spirit, that has also sanctified the daily labors and the so
~~called mundane affairs. the quran says that god has created man to
~~worship him but the word worship has a connotation of its own. gods
~~worship is not confined to prayer alone, but every act that is done with
~~the purpose of winning approval of god and is for the benefit of the
~~humanity comes under its purview. islam sanctifies life and all its
~~pursuits provided they are performed with honesty, justice and pure
~~intents. it obliterates the age-long distinction between the sacred and
~~profane. the quran says if you eat clean things and thank god for it, it
~~is an act of worship. it is saying of the prophet of islam that morsel
~~of food that one places in the mouth of his wife is an act of virtue to
~~be rewarded by god. PageV01P0265
# another tradition of the prophet says "he who is satisfying the desire
~~of his heart will be rewarded by god provided the methods adopted are
~~permissible. " a person was listening to him exclaimed 'o prophet of
~~god, he is answering the calls of passions, is only satisfying the
~~craving of his heart. forthwith came the reply, "had he adopted an awful
~~method for the satisfaction of his urge, he would have been punished;
~~then why should he not be rewarded for following the right course." this
~~new conception of religion that it should also devote itself to the
~~betterment of this life rather than concern itself exclusively with
~~super mundane affairs, has led to a new orientation of moral values. its
~~abiding influence on the common relations of mankind in the affairs of
~~every day life, its deep power over the masses, its regulation of their
~~conception of rights and duty, its suitability and adaptability to the
~~ignorant savage and the wise philosopher are characteristic features of
~~the teaching of the prophet of islam. but it should be most carefully
~~born in mind this stress on good actions is not the sacrifice
~~correctness of faith. while there are various school of thought, one
~~praising faith at the expense of deeds, another exhausting various acts
~~to the detriment of correct belief, islam is based on correct faith and
~~righteous actions. means are important as the end and ends are as
~~important as the means. it is an organic unity. together they live and
~~thrive. separate them and both decay and die. in islam faith can not be
~~divorced from the action. PageV01P0266
# right knowledge should be transferred into right action to produce the
~~right results. how often the words came in quran -- those who believe
~~and do good thing, they alone shall enter paradise. again and again, not
~~less than fifty times these words are repeated as if too much stress can
~~not be laid on them. contemplation is encouraged but mere contemplation
~~is not the goal. those who believe and do nothing can not exist in
~~islam. these who believe and do wrong are inconceivable. divine law is
~~the law of effort and not of ideals. it chalks out for the men the path
~~of eternal progress from knowledge to action and from action to
~~satisfaction. but what is the correct faith from which right action
~~spontaneously proceeds resulting in complete satisfaction. here the
~~central doctrine of islam is the unity of god. there is no god but god
~~is the pivot from which hangs the whole teaching and practice of islam.
~~he is unique not only as regards his divine being but also as regards
~~his divine attributes. as regards the attributes of god, islam adopts
~~here as in other things too, the law of golden mean. it avoids on the
~~one hand, the view of god which divests the divine being of every
~~attribute and rejects, on the other, the view which likens him to things
~~material. the quran says, on the one hand, there is nothing which is
~~like him, on the other , it affirms that he is seeing, hearing, knowing.
~~he is the king who is without a stain of fault or deficiency, the mighty
~~ship of his power floats upon the ocean of justice and equity. he is the
~~beneficent, the merciful. PageV01P0267
# he is the guardian over all. islam does not stop with this positive
~~statement. it adds further which is its most special characteristic, the
~~negative aspects of problem. there is also no one else who is guardian
~~over everything. he is the meander of every breakage, and no one else is
~~the meander of any breakage. he is the restorer of every loss and no one
~~else is the restorer of any loss what-so-over. there is no god but one
~~god, above any need, the maker of bodies, creator of souls, the lord of
~~the day of judgment, and in short, in the words of quran, to him belong
~~all excellent qualities. regarding the position of man in relation to
~~the universe, the quran says: "god has made subservient to you whatever
~~is on the earth or in universe. you are destined to rule over the
~~universe." but in relation to god, the quran says: "o man god has
~~bestowed on you excellent faculties and has created life and death to
~~put you to test in order to see whose actions are good and who has
~~deviated from the right path." in spite of free will which he enjoys, to
~~some extent, every man is born under certain circumstances and continues
~~to live under certain circumstances beyond his control. with regard to
~~this god says, according to islam, it is my will to create any man under
~~condition that seem best to me. cosmic plans finite mortals can not
~~fully comprehend. but i will certainly test you in prosperity as well in
~~adversity, in health as well as in sickness, in heights as well as in
~~depths. my ways of testing differ from man to man, from hour to hour.
~~PageV01P0268
# in adversity do not despair and do resort to unlawful means. it is but
~~a passing phase. in prosperity do not forget god. god-gifts are given
~~only as trusts. you are always on trial, every moment on test. in this
~~sphere of life there is not to reason why, there is but to do and die.
~~if you live in accordance with god; and if you die, die in the path of
~~god. you may call it fatalism. but this type of fatalism is a condition
~~of vigorous increasing effort, keeping you ever on the *****. do not
~~consider this temporal life on earth as the end of human existence.
~~there is a life after death and it is eternal. life after death is only
~~a connection link, a door that opens up hidden reality of life. every
~~action in life however insignificant, produces a lasting effect. it is
~~correctly recorded somehow. some of the ways of god are known to you,
~~but many of his ways are hidden from you. what is hidden in you and from
~~you in this world will be unrolled and laid open before you in the next.
~~the virtuous will enjoy the blessing of god which the eye has not seen,
~~nor has the ear heard, nor has it entered into the hearts of men to
~~conceive of they will march onward reaching higher and higher stages of
~~evolution. those who have wasted opportunity in this life shall under
~~the inevitable law, which makes every man taste of what he has done, be
~~subjugated to a course of treatment of the spiritual diseases which they
~~have brought about with their own hands. beware, it is terrible ordeal.
~~bodily pain is torture, you can bear somehow. spiritual pain is hell,
~~you will find it almost unbearable. PageV01P0269
# fight in this life itself the tendencies of the spirit prone to evil,
~~tempting to lead you into iniquities ways. reach the next stage when the
~~self-accusing sprit in your conscience is awakened and the soul is
~~anxious to attain moral excellence and revolt against disobedience. this
~~will lead you to the final stage of the soul at rest, *******ed with
~~god, finding its happiness and delight in him alone. the soul no more
~~stumbles. the stage of struggle passes away. truth is victorious and
~~falsehood lays down its arms. all complexes will then be resolved. your
~~house will not be divided against itself. your personality will get
~~integrated round the central core of submission to the will of god and
~~complete surrender to his divine purpose. all hidden energies will then
~~be released. the soul then will have peace. god will then address you:
~~"o thou soul that art at rest, and restest fully *******ed with thy lord
~~return to thy lord. he pleased with thee and thou pleased with him; so
~~enter among my servants and enter into my paradise." this is the final
~~goal for man; to become, on the, one hand, the master of the universe
~~and on the other, to see that his soul finds rest in his lord, that not
~~only his lord will be pleased with him but that he is also pleased with
~~his lord. *******ment, complete *******ment, satisfaction, complete
~~satisfaction, peace, complete peace. the love of god is his food at this
~~stage and he drinks deep at the fountain of life. sorrow and defeat do
~~not overwhelm him and success does not find him in vain and exulting.
~~PageV01P0270
# the western nations are only trying to become the master of the
~~universe. but their souls have not found peace and rest. thomas carlyle,
~~struck by this philosophy of life writes "and then also islam-that we
~~must submit to god; that our whole strength lies in resigned submission
~~to him, whatsoever he does to us, the thing he sends to us, even if
~~death and worse than death, shall be good, shall be best; we resign
~~ourselves to god." the same author continues "if this be islam, says
~~goethe, do we not all live in islam?" carlyle himself answers this
~~question of goethe and says "yes, all of us that have any moral life, we
~~all live so. this is yet the highest wisdom that heaven has revealed to
~~our earth." 3- "وحتى النور يرثي أخاه (قطعة أدبية تعرض بشكل مبسط العالم

~~,i'v searched through history to find a top example for human , and i
~~concluded that he is mohammed ..therefore the truth must be revealed and

~~is proudly enough that he has guided a whole nation to the light of
~~truth , and made it live peacefully , and has opened to it the path of
~~prosper and civilization ." lamartine the french poet says:'' the
~~remarkable incident in my whole life, is that i have studied the life of
~~prophet mohammed , and i realized its greatness and eternity , who dare
~~to compare any man from history with prophet mohammed ?!who is greater
~~than him ,looking to all criterion measuring man's greatness?!! his
~~behavior in the time of glory, his ambitions to spread the massage, his
~~long lasting prayers, and his celestial interlocution all are evidence
~~to a perfect faith that helped him to establish the basics of his

~~europe starts to understand the faith of monotheism , and may be more
~~than that , it confesses the ability of that faith to solve its problems
~~by a way leading to peace and happiness, so through that essence you
~~should understand my prediction"(5) "if we judge the greatness by
~~measuring the influence of that great on the people, so we should say
~~that mohammed is the greatest great in history ,he stopped racism and
~~myths ,and established over christianity and judaism and his country's
~~religion, a very clear and a strong religion , that succeeded to be
~~until these days a power with great danger" (6) "history has no man,

~~detail in the early sources show that he was an honest and upright man
~~who had gained the respect and loyalty of others who were like-wise
~~honest and upright men." (vol. 12) george bernard shaw said about him:
~~"he must be called the saviour of humanity. i believe that if a man like
~~him were to assume the dictatorship of the modern world, he would
~~succeed in solving its problems in a way that would bring it much needed
~~peace and happiness." (the genuine islam, singapore, vol. 1, no. 8,
~~1936) he was by far the most remarkable man that ever set foot on this
~~earth. he preached a religion, founded a state, built a nation, laid
~~down a moral code, initiated numerous social and political reforms,
~~established a powerful and dynamic society to practice and represent his
~~teachings and completely revolutionized the worlds of human thought and
~~behavior for all times to come. "his name is muhammad" may peace of god
~~be upon him (pbuh) he was born in arabia in the year 570 c.e. (common
~~era), started his mission of preaching the religion of truth, islam
~~(submission to one god) at the age of forty and departed from this world
~~at the age of sixty-three. PageV01P0283
# during this short period of 23 years of his prophethood, he changed
~~the complete arabian peninsula from paganism and idolatry to worship of
~~one god, from tribal quarrels and wars to national solidarity and
~~cohesion, from drunkenness and debauchery to sobriety and piety, from
~~lawlessness and anarchy to disciplined living, from utter bankruptcy to
~~the highest standards of moral excellence. human history has never known
~~such a complete transformation of a people or a place before or since -
~~and imagine all these unbelievable wonders in just over two decades.
~~lamartine, the renowned historian speaking on the essentials of human
~~greatness wonders: "if greatness of purpose, smallness of means and
~~astounding results are the three criteria of human genius, who could
~~dare to compare any great man in modern history with muhammad? the most
~~famous men created arms, laws and empires only. they founded, if
~~anything at all, no more than material powers which often crumbled away
~~before their eyes. this man moved not only armies, legislation, empires,
~~peoples and dynasties, but millions of men in one-third of the then
~~inhabited world; and more than that, he moved the altars, the gods, the
~~religions, the ideas, the beliefs and souls....his forbearance in
~~victory, his ambition, which was entirely devoted to one idea and in no
~~manner striving for an empire; his endless prayers, his mystic
~~conversations with god, his death and his triumph after death; all these
~~attest not to an imposture but to a firm conviction which gave him the
~~power to restore a dogma. PageV01P0284
# this dogma was two-fold, the unity of god and the immateriality of
~~god; the former telling what god is, the latter telling what god is not;
~~the one overthrowing false gods with the sword, the other starting an
~~idea with the words." "philosopher, orator, apostle, legislator,
~~warrior, conqueror of ideas, restorer of rational dogmas, of a cult
~~without images, the founder of twenty terrestrial empires and of one
~~spiritual empire, that is muhammad. as regards all the standards by
~~which human greatness may be measured, we may well ask, is there any man
~~greater than he?" (lamartine, histoire de la turquie, paris, 1854, vol.
~~ii, pp 276-277) the world has had its share of great personalities. but
~~these were one-sided figures who distinguished themselves in but one or
~~two fields, such as religious thought or military leadership. the lives
~~and teachings of these great personalities of the world are shrouded in
~~the mist of time. there is so much speculation about the time and place
~~of their birth, the mode and style of their life, the nature and detail
~~of their teachings and the degree and measure of their success or
~~failure that it is impossible for humanity to reconstruct accurately the
~~lives and teachings of these men. not so this man. muhammad (pbuh)
~~accomplished so much in such diverse fields of human thought and
~~behavior in the fullest blaze of human history. every detail of his
~~private life and public utterances has been accurately ********ed and
~~faithfully preserved to our day. PageV01P0285
# the authenticity of the record so preserved are vouched for not only
~~by the faithful followers but even by his prejudiced critics. muhammad
~~(pbuh) was a religious teacher, a social reformer, a moral guide, an
~~administrative colossus, a faithful friend, a wonderful companion, a
~~devoted husband, a loving father - all in one. no other man in history
~~ever excelled or equaled him in any of these different aspects of life -
~~but it was only for the selfless personality of muhammad (pbuh) to
~~achieve such incredible perfections. mahatma gandhi, speaking on the
~~character of muhammad, (pbuh) says in (young india): "i wanted to know
~~the best of one who holds today's undisputed sway over the hearts of
~~millions of mankind....i became more than convinced that it was not the
~~sword that won a place for islam in those days in the scheme of life. it
~~was the rigid simplicity, the utter self-effacement of the prophet, the
~~scrupulous regard for his pledges, his intense devotion to this friends
~~and followers, his intrepidity, his fearlessness, his absolute trust in
~~god and in his own mission. these and not the sword carried everything
~~before them and surmounted every obstacle. when i closed the 2nd volume
~~(of the prophet's biography), i was sorry there was not more for me to
~~read of the great life." thomas carlyle in his (heroes and heroworship),
~~was simply amazed as to: "how one man single-handedly, could weld
~~warring tribes and wandering bedouins into a most powerful and civilized
~~nation in less than two decades. PageV01P0286
# " diwan chand sharma wrote: "muhammad was the soul of kindness, and
~~his influence was felt and never forgotten by those around him." (d.c.
~~sharma, the prophets of the east, calcutta, 1935, pp. 12) edward gibbon
~~and simon ockley speaking on the profession of islam write: "'i believe
~~in one god, and mahomet, an apostle of god' is the simple and invariable
~~profession of islam. the intellectual image of the deity has never been
~~degraded by any visible idol; the honor of the prophet has never
~~transgressed the measure of human virtues; and his living precepts have
~~restrained the gratitude of his disciples within the bounds of reason
~~and religion." (history of the saracen empires, london, 1870, p. 54)
~~muhammad (pbuh) was nothing more or less than a human being. but he was
~~a man with a noble mission, which was to unite humanity on the worship
~~of one and only one god and to teach them the way to honest and upright
~~living based on the commands of god. he always described himself as, "a
~~servant and messenger of god," and so indeed every action of his
~~proclaimed to be. speaking on the aspect of equality before god in
~~islam, the famous poetess of india, sarojini naidu says: "it was the
~~first religion that preached and practiced democracy; for, in the
~~mosque, when the call for prayer is sounded and worshippers are gathered
~~together, the democracy of islam is embodied five times a day when the
~~peasant and king kneel side by side and proclaim: 'god alone is
~~great'... i have been struck over and over again by this indivisible
~~unity of islam that makes man instinctively a brother." (s. PageV01P0287
# naidu, ideals of islam, vide speeches & writings, madras, 1918, p.
~~169) in the words of prof. hurgronje: "the league of nations founded by
~~the prophet of islam put the principle of international unity and human
~~brotherhood on such universal foundations as to show candle to other
~~nations." he continues: "the fact is that no nation of the world can
~~show a parallel to what islam has done towards the realization of the
~~idea of the league of nations." the world has not hesitated to raise to
~~divinity, individuals whose lives and missions have been lost in legend.
~~historically speaking, none of these legends achieved even a fraction of
~~what muhammad (pbuh) accomplished. and all his striving was for the sole
~~purpose of uniting mankind for the worship of one god on the codes of
~~moral excellence. muhammad (pbuh) or his followers never at any time
~~claimed that he was a son of god or the god-incarnate or a man with
~~divinity - but he always was and is even today considered as only a
~~messenger chosen by god. michael h. hart in his recently published book
~~on ratings of men who contributed towards the benefit and upliftment of
~~mankind writes: "my choice of muhammad to lead the list of the world's
~~most influential persons may surprise some readers and may be questioned
~~by others, but he was the only man in history who was supremely
~~successful on both the religious and secular levels." (m.h. hart, the
~~100: a ranking of the most influential persons in history, new york,
~~1978, p. 33) k. s. PageV01P0288
# ramakrishna rao, an indian professor of philosophy in his booklet,
~~("muhammad, the prophet of islam,") calls him the "perfect model for
~~human life." prof. ramakrishna rao explains his point by saying: "the
~~personality of muhammad, it is most difficult to get into the whole
~~truth of it. only a glimpse of it i can catch. what a dramatic
~~succession of picturesque scenes! there is muhammad, the prophet. there
~~is muhammad, the warrior; muhammad, the businessman; muhammad, the
~~statesman; muhammad, the orator; muhammad, the reformer; muhammad, the
~~refuge of orphans; muhammad, the protector of slaves; muhammad, the
~~emancipator of women; muhammad, the judge; muhammad, the saint. all in
~~all these magnificent roles, in all these departments of human
~~activities, he is alike a hero." today after a lapse of fourteen
~~centuries, the life and teachings of muhammad (pbuh) have survived
~~without the slightest loss, alteration or interpolation. they offer the
~~same undying hope for treating mankind's many ills, which they did when
~~he was alive. this is not a claim of muhammad's (pbuh) followers but
~~also the inescapable conclusion forced upon by a critical and unbiased
~~history. PageV01P0289
# the least you could do as a thinking and concerned human being is to

~~and completely revolutionized the worlds of human thought and action for

~~god be upon him and he accomplished all these wonders in the
~~unbelievably short span of twenty-three years. muhammad, peace and
~~blessings of god almighty be upon him was born in arabia on the 20th of
~~august, in the year 570 of the christian era, and when he died after 63
~~years, the whole of the arabian peninsula had changed from paganism and

~~national solidarity and cohesion; from drunkenness and debauchery to
~~sobriety and piety; from lawlessness and anarchy to disciplined living;
~~from utter moral bankruptcy to the highest standards of moral

# human history has never known such a complete transformation of a

~~"the most successful of all religious personalities of the world".
~~bernard shaw said about him that if muhammad were alive today he would
~~succeed in solving all those problems which threaten to destroy human
~~civilization in our times. thomas carlysle was simply amazed as to how
~~one man, single-handedly, could weld warring tribes and wandering
~~bedouins into a most powerful and civilized nation in less than two
~~decades. napoleon and gandhi never tired of dreaming of a society along
~~the lines established by this man in arabia fourteen centuries ago.
~~indeed no other human being ever accomplished so much, in such diverse
~~fields of human thought and behavior, in so limited a space of time, as
~~did muhammad, peace and blessings of god almighty be upon him. he was a
~~religious teacher, a social reformer, a moral guide, a political
~~thinker, a military genius, an administrative colossus, a faithful
~~friend, a wonderful companion, a devoted husband, a loving father - all

~~place of their birth, the mode and style of their life, the nature and

~~only was he born in the fullest blaze of recorded history, but every
~~detail of his private and public life, of his actions and utterances,
~~has been accurately ********ed and faithfully preserved to our day. the
~~authenticity of the information so preserved is vouched for not only by
~~faithful followers but also by unbiased critics and open-minded
~~scholars. at the level of ideas there is no system of thought and
~~belief-secular or religious, social or political-which could surpass or
~~equal islaam- the system which muhammad peace and blessings of god
~~almighty be upon him propounded. in a fast changing world, while other
~~systems have undergone profound transformations, islaam alone has
~~remained above all change and mutation, and retained its original form
~~for the past 1400 years. PageV01P0293
# what is more, the positive changes that are taking place in the world
~~of human thought and behavior, truly and consistently reflect the
~~healthy influence of islam in these areas. further, it is not given to
~~the best of thinkers to put their ideas completely into practice, and to
~~see the seeds of their labors grow and bear fruit, in their own
~~lifetime. except of course, muhammad, peace and blessings of god
~~almighty be upon him, who not only preached the most wonderful ideas but
~~also successfully translated each one of them into practice in his own
~~lifetime. at the time of his death his teachings were not mere precepts
~~and ideas straining for fulfillment, but had become the very core of the
~~life of tens of thousands of perfectly trained individuals, each one of
~~whom was a marvelous personification of everything that muhammad peace
~~and blessings of god almighty be upon him taught and stood for. at what
~~other time or place and in relation to what other political, social,
~~religious system, philosophy or ideology-did the world ever witness such
~~a perfectly amazing phenomenon? indeed no other system or ideology
~~secular or religious, social or political, ancient or modern - could
~~ever claim the distinction of having been put into practice in its
~~fullness and entirety even once in this world, either before or after
~~the death of its founder. except of course islaam, the ideology preached
~~by muhammad, peace and blessings of god almighty be upon him which was
~~established as a complete way of life by the teacher himself, before he
~~departed from this world. PageV01P0294
# history bears testimony to this fact and the greatest skeptics have no
~~option but to concede this point. in spite of these amazing achievements
~~and in spite of the countless absolutely convincing and authentic
~~miracles performed by him and the phenomenal success which crowned his
~~efforts, he did not for a moment claim to be god or god's incarnation or
~~son - but only a human being who was chosen and ordained by god to be a
~~teacher of truth to man kind and a complete model and pattern for their
~~actions. he was nothing more or less than a human being. but he was a
~~man with a noble and exalted mission-and his unique mission was to unite
~~humanity on the worship of one and only god and to teach them the way to
~~honest and upright living in accordance with the laws and commands of
~~god. he always described himself as a messenger and servant of god, and
~~so indeed every single action and movement of his proclaimed him to be.
~~a world which has not hesitated to raise to divinity individuals whose
~~very lives and missions have been lost in legend and who historically
~~speaking did not accomplish half as much-or even one tenth-as was
~~accomplished by muhammad, peace and blessings of god almighty be upon

~~meters high from the days of ishmael. it was also roofless and that gave
~~the thieves easy access to its treasures inside. it was also exposed to
~~the wearing factors of nature because it was built a long time ago –
~~that weakened and cracked its walls. five years before the prophethood,
~~there was a great flood in makkah that swept towards the ka'bah and
~~almost demolished it. quraysh were obliged to rebuild it to safeguard
~~its sanctity and position. the chiefs of quraysh decided to use only
~~money earned honestly, in rebuilding the ka'bah, so all the monies
~~derived from harlotry, usury or unjust practices were excluded.
~~PageV01P0297
# they were, at first too afraid to knock down the wall, but al-waleed
~~bin al-mugheerah al-mukhzumi started the work. seeing that no harm had
~~happened to him, the others participated in demolishing the walls until
~~they reached the foundation laid by abraham. when they started
~~rebuilding its walls, they divided the work among the tribes. each tribe
~~was responsible for rebuilding a part of it. the tribes collected stones
~~and started work. the man who laid the stones was a roman mason called
~~baqum. the work went on in harmony till the time came to put the sacred
~~black stone in its proper place. then strife broke out among the chiefs,
~~and lasted for four or five days, each contesting for the honor of
~~placing the stone in its position. daggers were on the point of being
~~drawn and bloodshed seemed imminent. luckily, the oldest among the
~~chiefs, abu omaiyah bin mugheerah al-makhzumi, made a proposal which was
~~accepted by all. he said: "let him, who first enters the sanctuary in
~~the morning decide on the issue.” it was then allah’s will that young
~~muhammed, the future messenger of allah should be the first to enter the
~~mosque. on seeing him, all the people at the scene, cried with one
~~voice: “al-ameen (the trustworthy) has come. we are ******* to abide by
~~his decision.” calm and self-possessed, muhammed (peace be upon him)
~~received the commission and at once resolved upon an expedient solution,
~~which was to satisfy them all. he asked for a mantle which he spread on
~~the ground and placed the stone in its center. PageV01P0298
# he then asked the representatives of the different clans among them,
~~to lift each corner of the cloth. when they reached the proper place,
~~muhammed laid it in its proper position with his own hands. this is how
~~a very tense situation was eased and a grave danger averted by the
~~wisdom of muhammed even before he became a prophet (peace be upon him).
~~on mount safa al-bukhaari reported part of this story on the authority
~~of ibn ‘abbas. he said: “when the following verses were revealed: “and
~~warn your tribe (o muhammed – peace be upon him) of near kindred.”
~~[26:214] the messenger of allah (peace be upon him) ascended mount safa
~~and started to call: “o bani fahr! o bani ‘adi (two tribes of quraysh).”
~~many people gathered and those who could not come sent somebody to
~~report to them. abu lahab was also present. the prophet (peace be upon
~~him) said: “consider, if i were to tell you that there were some
~~horsemen in the valley planning to raid you, will you believe me?” they
~~said: “yes, we have never experienced any lie from you.” he said: “i am
~~a warner to you before a severe torment.” abu lahab promptly replied:
~~“perish you all the day! have you summoned us for such a thing?” the
~~observation of an-nadr bin al harith once an-nadr bin harith addressed
~~the quraysh people in the following manner: “o quraysh! you have
~~experienced an unprecedented phenomenon before which you have so far
~~been desperately helpless. muhammed grew up here among you and always
~~proved to be highly obliging, the most truthful and trustworthy young
~~man. PageV01P0299
# however, later on when he reached manhood, he began to preach a new
~~faith alien to your society, and opposed to your liking so you began to
~~denounce him at times as a sorcerer, and at another as a soothsayer, a
~~poet and even as insane person. i swear by allah that he is not anyone
~~of those. he is not interested in blowing on knots as magicians do, nor
~~do his words belong to the world of soothsaying. he is not a poet
~~either, for his mentality is not that of a rambler, nor is he insane
~~because he has never been seen to suffer from any sort of hallucinations
~~or insinuations peculiar to madmen. o people of quraysh, it is really a
~~serious issue and i recommend that you reconsider your attitude.”
~~heracules and abu sufyan al-bukhaari, on the authority of ibn abbas,
~~narrated that heracules sent for abu sufyan and his companions, who
~~happened to be trading in jerusalem. that was during the time of the
~~truce that had been concluded between the polytheists of quraysh and the
~~messenger of allah (peace be upon him). heracules, seated amongst his
~~chiefs of staff, asked, “who amongst you is the nearest relative to the
~~man who claims to be a prophet (peace be upon him)?” “(abu sufyan)
~~replied: ‘i am the nearest relative to him from amongst the group.” so
~~they made me sit in front of him and made my companions sit behind me.
~~then he called upon his translator and said (to him). “tell them (i.e.
~~abu sufyan’s companions) that i am going to ask him (i.e. abu sufyan)
~~regarding that man who claims to be a prophet. so if he tells a lie,
~~they should contradict him (instantly)’. PageV01P0300
# abu sufyan, an ardent enemy of the prophet (peace be upon him)
~~commented: “by allah, had i not been afraid that my companions would
~~consider me a liar, i would have told lies.” abu sufyan’s testimony went
~~as follows: “muhammed descends from a noble family. no one of his family
~~happened to assume kingship. his followers are those deemed to be among
~~the weak, with their numbers ever growing. he neither tells lies nor
~~betrays others. we fight him and he fights us but with alternate
~~victories. he bids people to worship allah alone with no polytheism and
~~to abandon our fathers’ beliefs. he orders us to observe prayer,
~~honesty, abstinence and maintain strong family ties.” heracules, on
~~hearing this testimony, turned to his translator bidding him to
~~communicate to us his following impression which reveals full conviction
~~in the truthfulness of muhammed’s prophethood: “i fully realize that
~~prophets come from noble families; he does not affect any previous
~~example of prophethood. since none of his ancestors was a monarch, we
~~cannot then allege that he is a man trying to reclaim his father’s
~~monarchy. so long as he does not tell lies to people, he is immune to
~~telling lies as regards allah. concerning his followers being those
~~deemed weak with numbers ever growing, it is something that goes in
~~agreement with questions of faith until it later assumes full dimensions
~~geographically and demographically. i have understood that no instance
~~of apostasy has as yet appear among his followers and this points to the
~~bliss of faith that finds its abode in the human heart. PageV01P0301
# betrayal, as i see, is alien to him because a real prophet (peace be
~~upon him)s hold betrayal in abhorrence. bidding worship of allah with no
~~associates, observance of prayer, honesty and abstinence and prohibition
~~of paganism are traits bound to subject to him all my possessions. i
~~have already known that a prophet (peace be upon him) must arise but it
~~has never occurred to me that he will be an arab from among you. if i
~~was sure i would be faithful to him, i might hope to meet him, and if i
~~were with him, i would wash his feet.’ heracules then requested that the
~~prophet’s letter be read. the observation of the emperor and finally the
~~definite and clear-cut exposition of the islamic message could not but
~~create a tense atmosphere amongst the clergy present at the court. abu
~~sufyan and his companions were ordered to go out. abu sufyan said,
~~“while coming out, i said to my companions, “the matter of ibn abi
~~kabshah (meaning muhammed – has become so prominent that even the king
~~of banu al-asfar (i.e. the romans) is afraid of him.’ so i continued to
~~believe that allah’s messenger would be victorious, until allah made me
~~embrace islam.” the king did not embrace islam – for it was differently
~~ordained. however, the muslim envoy was sent back to madinah with the
~~felicitations of the emperor. ************************************** al-

~~prophethood PageV01P0302
# all praise and gratitude is to allah – our creator, provider and the
~~maintainer of all the worlds. muslims believe that muhammad (may allah's
~~blessings and peace be upon him) was the final prophet of god, sent to
~~the whole of mankind to call the people to worship the creator alone,
~~and show praise and gratitude to him. the following are some proofs of
~~his prophethood. 1. muhammad (may allah's blessings and peace be upon
~~him) was raised illiterate, unable to read or write, and remained like
~~that till his death. among all his people, he was known as being
~~truthful and trustworthy. before receiving revelation, he had no prior
~~knowledge of religion or any previously sent message. he remained like
~~that for his first forty years. revelation then came to muhammad with
~~the qur’an that we have in our hands today. this qur’an mentioned most
~~of the accounts found in the previous ******ures, telling us about these
~~events in the greatest detail as if he witnessed them. these accounts
~~came precisely as they were found in the torah sent down to moses and in
~~the gospel sent down to jesus. 2. muhammad (may allah's blessings and
~~peace be upon him) also foretold of things that would occur to him and
~~his community after him, pertaining to victory, the removal of the
~~tyrannical kingdoms of choruses [the royal title for the zoroastrian
~~kings of persia] and caesar, and the establishment of the religion of
~~islam throughout the earth. these events occurred exactly as muhammad
~~foretold, as if he was reading the future from an open book. 3.
~~PageV01P0303
# muhammad (may allah's blessings and peace be upon him) also brought an
~~arabic qur’an that is the peak of eloquence and clarity. the qur’an
~~challenged those eloquent and fluent arabs of his time, who initially
~~belied him, to bring forth a single chapter like the qur’an. the
~~eloquent arabs of his day were unable to contest this qur’an. indeed,
~~till our day, none has ever dared to claim that he has been able to
~~compose words that equal-or even approach-the order, grace, beauty, and
~~splendor of this glorious qur’an. 4. the life history of this noble
~~prophet was a perfect example of being upright, merciful, compassionate,
~~truthful, brave, generous, distant from all evil character, and ascetic
~~in all worldly matters, while striving solely for the reward of the
~~hereafter. moreover, in all his actions and dealings, he was ever
~~mindful and fearful of the creator. 5. allah instilled great love for
~~muhammad (may allah's blessings and peace be upon him) in the hearts of
~~all who believed in and met him. this love reached such a degree that
~~any of his companions would willingly sacrifice his (or her) self,
~~mother or father for him. till today, those who believe in muhammad
~~honor and love him. anyone of those who believe in him would ransom his
~~own family and wealth to see him, even if but once. 6. all of history
~~has not preserved the biography of any person in the manner it has
~~preserved the life of muhammad, who is the most influential human in
~~history. PageV01P0304
# nor has the entire earth known of anyone whom every morning and
~~evening, and many times thereafter throughout the day, are thought of by
~~those who believe in him. upon remembering muhammad, the believers in
~~him will greet him and ask allah to bless him. they do such with full
~~hearts and true love for him. 7. nor has there been a man on earth whom
~~is still followed in all his doings by those who believe in him. those
~~who believe in muhammad sleep in the manner he slept; purify themselves
~~(through ablution and ritual washing) in the manner he purified himself;
~~and adhere to his practice in the way they eat, drink, and clothe
~~themselves. indeed in all aspects of their lives, the believers in
~~muhammad adhere to the teachings he spread among them and the path that
~~he traveled upon during his life. during every generation, from his day
~~till our time, the believers in this noble prophet have fully adhered to
~~his teachings. let alone all that, all those who believe in muhammad
~~repeat those praises of allah, special prayers, and invocations that he
~~would say during each of his actions, supplicating to allah during day
~~and night, like: what he would say when he greeted people, upon entering
~~and leaving the house, entering and leaving the mosque, entering and
~~leaving the bathroom, going to sleep and awaking from sleep, observing
~~the new crescent, observing the new fruit on trees, eating, drinking,
~~dressing, riding, traveling and returning from travel, etc. PageV01P0305
# all those who believe in muhammad fully perform-even to the minute
~~detail-every act of worship-like prayer, fasting, charity, and
~~pilgrimage-as this noble messenger (may allah's blessings and peace be
~~upon him) taught and as he himself performed. all of this allows those
~~who believe in him, to live their lives in all aspects with this noble
~~messenger as their example, as if he was standing before them, for them
~~to follow in all their doings. 8. there has never been, nor will there
~~ever be a man anywhere upon this earth who has received such love,
~~respect, honor, and obedience in all matters-small and large alike-as
~~has this noble prophet. 9. since his day, in every region of the earth
~~and during every period, this noble prophet has been followed by
~~individuals from all races, colors and peoples. many of those who
~~followed him were previously christians, jews, pagans, idolaters, or
~~without any religion. among those who chose to follow him, were those
~~who were known for their sound judgment, wisdom, reflection, and
~~foresight. they chose to follow this noble prophet after they witnessed
~~the signs of his truthfulness and the evidences of his miracles. they
~~did not choose to follow muhammad out of compulsion or coercion or
~~because they had adopted the ways of their fathers and mothers. indeed
~~many of the followers of this prophet (may allah's blessings peace be
~~upon him), chose to follow him during the time when islam was weak, when
~~there were few muslims, and when there was severe persecution of his
~~followers on earth. PageV01P0306
# most people who have followed this prophet (may allah's blessings and
~~peace be upon him) have done so not to acquire some material benefits.
~~indeed many of his followers have suffered the greatest forms of harm
~~and persecution as a result of following this prophet. despite all this
~~harm and persecution, this did not turn them back from his religion. all
~~of this clearly indicates, that this prophet was truly and really
~~allah's messenger and that he was not just a man who claimed prophet
~~hood or spoke about allah without knowledge. 10. with all this, muhammad
~~came with a great religion in its creedal and legal make-up. muhammad
~~described allah with qualities of complete perfection, and at the same
~~time in a manner that is free of ascribing to him any imperfection.
~~neither the philosophers nor the wise could ever describe allah like
~~such. indeed it is impossible to imagine that any human mind could
~~conceive of an existing being that possesses such complete ability,
~~knowledge, and greatness; who has subdued the creation and has
~~encompassed everything in the universe, small or large; and possesses
~~such perfect mercy. nor is it in the ability of any human being to place
~~a perfect law based upon justice, equality, mercy and objectivity for
~~all human activity on earth like the laws that muhammad brought for all
~~spheres of human activity - like buying and selling, marriage and
~~divorce, renting, testimony, custody, and all other contracts that are
~~necessary to uphold life and civilization on earth. 11. PageV01P0307
# it is impossible that any person conceive wisdom, morals, good
~~manners, nobleness of characters as what this honorable prophet (may
~~allah's blessings and peace be upon him) brought. in a full and complete
~~manner, muhammad spread a teaching regarding character and manners
~~toward one's parents, relatives, fiends, family, humanity, animals,
~~plants and inanimate objects. it is impossible for the human mind alone
~~to grasp all of that teaching or come with a similar teaching. all of
~~that un*****ocally indicates that this messenger did not bring this
~~religion from his own accord, but that it was rather a teaching and
~~inspiration that he received from the one who created the earth and the
~~high heavens above and created this universe in its miraculous
~~architecture and perfection. 12. the legal and creedal make-up of the
~~religion that the messenger, muhammad, (may allah’s blessings and peace
~~be upon him) brought resembles the engineering of the heavens and the
~~earth. all of that indicates that he who created the heavens and the
~~earth is the one who sent down this great law and upright religion. the
~~degree of inimitability of the divine law that was sent down upon
~~muhammad is to the same degree of inimitability of the divine creation
~~of the heavens and earth. for just as humanity cannot create this
~~universe, in the same manner humanity cannot bring forth a law like
~~allah's law that he sent down upon his servant and messenger muhammad
~~(may allah's blessings and peace be upon him). 9- اثنا عشر دليل على صحة

~~profile, etc.) and a person's "actions" or behavior such as type a, b,
~~or c personality. PageV01P0317
# the present article attempts to show our current knowledge in our
~~ability to perform genetic screening in order to understand a person's
~~inheritance of carrying or developing a certain disease through the
~~study of that person's genes. our knowledge is still incomplete and we
~~are very far away in attaining the knowledge about the four matters
~~mentioned in this hadith. inside the nucleus of a living cell there are
~~46 chromosomes which are visible only when the cell divides. the
~~chromosomes are made of dna or deoxyribonucleic acid. a certain length
~~of the dna is called the gene. that length of dna that codes for
~~complete synthesis of a protein is also called a gene. along the 46
~~chromosomes of every human cell are some 100,000 genes. the u.s.
~~government is funding a $3 billion, 15-year human genome project, under
~~the joint leadership of the national institutes of health and the
~~department of energy, which will allow scientists to know exactly where
~~on our chromosomes each of our 100,000 genes reside. among these 100,000
~~genes, there are a few genes, which can be lethal. every person has a
~~unique set of these seven or eight deadly genes. they are usually
~~hidden, but in the wrong environment or in combination with certain
~~other genes they can express themselves in dangerous ways. some families
~~carry genetic diseases for generations and they know what type of lethal
~~genes they carry. most of the people do not know if they carry any
~~genetically defective genes. PageV01P0318
# in the near future it is possible to get a blue print of our genetic
~~inheritance-and with the knowledge of the most likely cause of our own
~~death. this test can be performed by walking into a physician's office
~~and giving a blood sample with a finger prick. the results of the test
~~reveal if a person has any defective genes that will cause a certain
~~disease or the result may be negative in which case that person will not
~~carry the disease. most of the adult-onset diseases involve several
~~genes. for example there are at least 17 genes responsible for just one
~~aspect of coronary heart disease-and the genes express themselves only
~~under certain conditions. for most of the genetic diseases it is
~~impossible to predict with a certainty. geneticists now say that
~~diabetes, hypertension, and cancer run in families. in other words these
~~diseases are genetically inherited. geneticists can treat adults for the
~~presence of a handful of relatively rare genes - among them those that
~~cause huntington's disease (causes progressive brain degeneration);
~~adult polycystic kidney disease (causes gradual loss of kidney
~~function); polypsos (this condition leads to colon cancer);
~~hemochromatosis (which could cause liver failure); and certain forms of
~~cancer such as retinoblastoma, some leukemias, and small-cell carcinoma
~~of the lung. there are two important questions, which have not been
~~answered so far. PageV01P0319
# the first one is whether knowledge of the information is itself
~~potentially hazardous to the individual; and the second one is whether
~~institutions will misuse that knowledge to promote their own dominance
~~and control. there are two types of tests: prenatal tests and genetic
~~screening tests. the prenatal tests inform future parents of a child's
~~chances of inheriting a condition for which the parent is a carrier-tay-
~~sachs disease, sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis- or of inheriting a
~~condition from which a family member has already died-muscular
~~dystrophy, hemophilia, beta-thalassemia. the genetic screening test
~~tells the adults about their own genetic destiny. but do we really want
~~to know? are we willing to learn the details of our genetic destiny-
~~especially when it involves diseases for which there is no cure? are we
~~capable of understanding the uncertainties inherent in this high-tech
~~fortunetelling? adult polycystic kidney disease comes late in age and
~~causes degenerative condition of the kidneys resulting in gradual loss
~~of kidney function. it is carried on a single, dominant gene. if a man
~~has the disease, then his son has a 50-50 chance of having the gene and
~~if he has two daughters, their chances of having the disease is also
~~50-50. usually this disease strikes when one is in his or her 110's. the
~~genetic test only tells whether a persons has the gene that causes the
~~disease, but it doesn't tell whether that person gets the disease in his
~~uo ' s or in his late 60's. no treatment exists to prevent kidney
~~failure in polycystic kidney patients. PageV01P0320
# there is a certain amount of unwillingness on the part of humans to
~~know their future. however there are individuals who have taken the
~~tests for the occurrence of huntington's disease which is a neurological
~~disease, a progressive and untreatable brain and muscle degeneration
~~with symptoms that usually show themselves in the 40's. the chances of
~~inheriting this disease causing gene is also 50-50. those who took the
~~test and whose results were positive, there were no instances of suicide
~~and only one of severe depression, and one marital breakup among the 71
~~patients screened. nancy wexler of the hereditary disease foundation
~~says "if the information is limiting, enervating, depressing, if it
~~tears at your self-esteem, if it gives you nothing to do, it might be
~~better not to know." she devoted her professional life to the search for
~~the gene for huntington's disease which killed her mother and for which
~~she and her sister are at risk. scientists stress that the results of
~~genetic testing are ambiguous: genes alone do not determine a disease's
~~prognosis. one can say whether or not an individual appears to have the
~~gene, and those who have the gene have gone on to develop the disease.
~~but one cannot say anything about when the disease will start, what will
~~be the course of the disease, and what will be the relevant aspects of
~~the illness. PageV01P0321
# the danger comes when imprecise tests are used inorder to predict the
~~future, and when institutions actually use them to construct the future:
~~when employers refuse to hire or train individuals at high risk of dying
~~in their prime; when health-insurance companies insist on knowing the
~~genetic profiles of their potential subscribers before paying for pre-
~~existing genetic conditions; when schools require a permanent genetic
~~record to anticipate which children will exhibit behavioral problems or
~~learning disabilities. in united states genetic discrimination already
~~exists. the risk of increasing the number of people defined as
~~unemployable, uneducable or uninsurable exists. genetic tests can
~~identify employees who are susceptible to workplace toxins and companies
~~may prohibit hiring such employees because they may contract
~~occupational illnesses. 17 companies out of 500 had used genetic tests
~~within the last 12 years, and 59 were considering the possibility. there
~~is the danger of using the genetic tests for purposes of "eugenics."
~~eugenics means the deliberate manipulation of the gene pool with the
~~idea of creating a master race. defective people walking around may not
~~be allowed to reproduce for the betterment of society. many of the
~~conditions that will be uncovered through genetic studies are not life
~~threatening, but might not fit into some societal scheme: genetic
~~dyslexia, for example; genetic shyness; genetic arrogance; genetic left-
~~handedness. it is known that left-handed people have shorter life
~~expectancies, which is relevant to insurance companies. PageV01P0322
# but left-handed people may suffer for lack of knowledge whether left-
~~handedness occurs for reasons other than genetic. they may be construed
~~from birth as brain-damaged. allah is all knowing. 11- مبادئ النجاح 11-
~~principles of success principles of success— in the light of seerah by
~~maulana wahiduddin khan it is a well-known fact that the prophet of
~~islam (pbuh) was the supremely successful man in the entire human
~~history. but he was not just a hero, as thomas carlyle has called him.
~~according to the qur’an, he was a good example for all mankind. he has
~~shown us the way of achieving supreme success in this world. by studying
~~the life of the prophet we can derive those important principles which
~~were followed by the prophet. in short, the prophet of islam was a
~~positive thinker in the full sense of the word. all his activities were
~~result-oriented. he completely refrained from all such steps as may
~~prove counter-productive. first principle: to begin from the possible
~~this principle is well explained in a saying of aishah. she said:
~~"whenever the prophet had to choose between two options, he always opted
~~for the easier choice." (al-bukhari)to choose the easiest option means
~~to begin from the possible, and one who begins from the possible will
~~surely reach his goal second principle: to see advantage in disadvantage
~~in the early days of mecca, there were many problems and difficulties.
~~at that time, a guiding verse in the qur’an was revealed. it said: "with
~~every hardship there is ease, with every hardship there is ease."
~~(94:5-6). PageV01P0323
# this means that if there are some problems, there are also
~~opportunities at the same time. and the way to success is to ignore the
~~problems and avail the opportunities . third principle: to change the
~~place of action this principle is derived from the hijrah. hijrah was
~~not just a migration from mecca to medina. it was to find a more
~~suitable place for islamic work, as history proved later on . fourth
~~principle: to make a friend out of an enemy the prophet of islam was
~~repeatedly subjected to practices of antagonism by the unbelievers. at
~~that time the qur’an enjoined upon him the return of good for evil. and
~~then, as the qur’an added, "you will see your direst enemy has become
~~your closest friend" (41:34). it means that a good deed in return of a
~~bad deed has a conquering effect over your enemies. and the life of the
~~prophet is a historical proof of this principle . fifth principle: to
~~turn minus into plus after the battle of badr, about 70 of the
~~unbelievers were taken as the prisoners of war. they were educated
~~people. the prophet announced that if any one of them would teach ten
~~muslim children how to read and write he would be freed. this was the
~~first school in the history of islam in which all of the students were
~~muslims, and all of the teachers were from the enemy rank. here i shall
~~quote a british orientalist who remarked about the prophet of islam: he
~~faced adversity with the determination to wring success out of failure .
~~PageV01P0324
# sixth principle: the power of peace is stronger than the power of
~~violence when mecca was conquered, all of the prophet’s direst opponents
~~were brought before him. they were war criminals, in every sense of the
~~word. but the prophet did not order to kill them. he simply said: "go,
~~you are free." the result of this kind behavior was miraculous. they
~~immediately accepted islam . seventh principle: not to be a dichotomous
~~thinker in the famous ghazwa of muta, khalid bin walid decided to
~~withdraw muslim forces from the battlefield because he discovered that
~~the enemy was unproportionately outnumbered. when they reached medina,
~~some of the muslims received them by the word "o furrar" (o deserters!)
~~the prophet said "no. they are kurrar" (men of advancement)." those
~~medinan people were thinking dichotomously, either fighting or
~~retreating. the prophet said no. there is also a third option, and that
~~is to avoid war and find a time to strengthen yourself. now history
~~tells us that the muslims, after three years of preparation, advanced
~~again towards the roman border and this time they won a resounding
~~victory . eighth principle: to bring the battle in one’s own favorable
~~field this principle is derived from the ghazwa of hudaibiyya. at that
~~time, the unbelievers were determined to engage muslims in fighting,
~~because obviously they were in an advantageous position. but the
~~prophet, by accepting their conditions unilaterally, entered into a
~~pact. it was a ten-year peace treaty. until then, the meeting ground
~~between muslims and non-muslims had been on the battlefield.
~~PageV01P0325
# now the area of conflict became that of ideological debate. within two
~~years, islam emerged as victorious because of the simple reason of its
~~ideological superiority . ninth principle: gradualism instead of
~~radicalism this principle is well-established by a hadith of al-bukhari.
~~aishah says that the first verses of the qur’an were related mostly to
~~heaven and hell. and then after a long time when the people’s hearts had
~~softened, the specific commands to desist from adultery and drinking
~~were revealed in the qur’an.this is a clear proof that for social
~~changes, islam advocates the evolutionary method, rather than the
~~revolutionary method . tenth principle: to be pragmatic in controversial
~~matters during the writing of hudaibiyyah treaty, the prophet dictated
~~these words: "this is from muhammad, the messenger of god." the qurayshi
~~delegate raised objections over these words. the prophet promptly
~~changed the word and ordered to write simply muhammad, son of abdullah.
~~these were the principles through which the prophet of islam gained that
~~success which has been recognized by historians as the supreme success.
~~in the end, i would like to repeat those ten principles of success: 1.
~~to begin from the possible 2. to see advantage in disadvantage 3. to
~~change the place of action 4. to make a friend out of an enemy 5. to
~~turn minus into plus 6. the power of peace is stronger than the power of
~~violence 7. not to be a dichotomous thinker 8. to bring the battle in
~~one’s own favorable field 9. gradualism instead of radicalism 10. to be
~~pragmatic in controversial matters PageV01P0326
# 12- صدق النبي محمد (عليه الصلاة والسلام) 12- truthfulness of muhammad
~~(pbuh) truthfulness of muhammad (pbuh) truthfulness of muhammad (pbuh)
~~"and if thou say in thine heart, how shall we know the word which the
~~lord hath not spoken? when a prophet speaketh in the name of the lord,
~~if the thing follow not, nor come to pass, that [is] the thing which the
~~lord hath not spoken, [but] the prophet hath spoken it presumptuously:
~~thou shalt not be afraid of him." deuteronomy 18:21-22 so if the
~~statements made in the qur'an were not true then this would prove that
~~it is not the word of god. however, there is not a single claim made in
~~the qur'an that has been scientifically and objectively refuted as
~~false. quite the contrary, there is not one, but tens of scientific and
~~historical statements to be found in the qur'an which have just begun to
~~be scrutinized by modern scientists and historians and which, according
~~to many non-muslim world renowned, pioneering scientists of the united
~~states, germany, canada, japan, taiwan, india and many other nations,
~~could not have been known by an illiterate man of the desert fourteen
~~hundred years ago (see chapter 13). they themselves have only discovered
~~these facts through the use of microscopes, telescopes, satellites, and
~~various other scientific equipment that was not available to muhammad
~~(pbuh). these statements range over the fields of embryology,
~~oceanography, geology, astronomy, anatomy, physics, and many others.
~~some of them have only been discovered during the last twenty years.
~~PageV01P0327
# these facts could not even have been copied from the bible because
~~many of them are either completely missing from the bible or totally
~~oppose similar verses in the bible. if muhammad (pbuh) had plagiarized
~~the bible, then did he also selectively correct incorrect scientific
~~statements in it? it is also interesting to note that christian scholars
~~readily acknowledge that the bible was not translated into arabic until
~~at least the eighth century ad, long after the death of muhammad (pbuh)
~~in 632c.e. you may get a side-by-side comparison of the biblical vs. the
~~quranic versions of many scientific facts by referring to dr. maurice
~~bucaille's books: "the bible, the qur'an, and science." i also highly
~~recommend the following books: "qur'an and modern science correlation
~~studies," by keith l. moore, abdul-majeed a. zindani, mustafa a. ahmed,
~~and "the developing human," by dr. keith moore. these books speak about
~~embryology in the qur'an, and other topics. source

~~نبوءة النبي موسى عليه السلام بالنبي محمد عليه الصلاة والسلام 13- moses
~~foretells of muhammad's coming moses foretells of muhammad's coming
~~PageV01P0328
# moses foretells of muhammad's coming "i (god) will raise them up a
~~prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee (moses), and will put
~~my words in his mouth; and he shall speak unto them all that i shall
~~command him." deuteronomy 18:18 there are many verses in the old
~~testament that predict the coming of jesus (pbuh). this one, however, is
~~not one of them. this can be clearly seen from the following four
~~points: a) like unto moses muslims believe in all of the previous
~~prophets. they make no distinction between them, nor do they place one
~~above the others in piety. however, they are all human, and as humans
~~they differ from one another in their characteristics. let us compare
~~these characteristics: 1) both christians and muslims agree that both
~~moses and muhammad (pbut) had fathers and mothers. they both also
~~believe that jesus (pbuh) had only a mother and no father. therefore,
~~muhammad is like moses, but jesus is unlike moses. 2) both moses and
~~muhammad (pbut) married and begat children. jesus (pbuh) never married
~~nor had any offspring. therefore, muhammad is like moses, but jesus is
~~unlike moses. 3) moses (pbuh) was accepted by the jews and to this day,
~~as a nation, they accept him as their prophet. muhammad (pbuh) was
~~accepted by his people, and as a nation, over one billion muslims around
~~the world accept him as the prophet of allah. jesus (pbuh), however, was
~~rejected by his people (the jews) as stated in the christian's own
~~bible: "he (jesus) came unto his own, but his own received him not"
~~(john 1:11) therefore, muhammad is like moses, but jesus is unlike
~~moses. PageV01P0329
# 4) both moses and muhammad (pbut) were kings on earth in the sense
~~that they had the ultimate power of government, the power to inflict
~~capital punishment. when the jews brought before moses (pbuh) the
~~israelite who had been caught collecting firewood on the sabbath, moses
~~had him stoned to death (numbers 15:36). muhammad (pbuh) had similar
~~authority. when a woman came before him confessing (with no witnesses)
~~to having committed adultery, he gave her a chance to consider the
~~severity of her claim and the punishment she would receive. when she
~~insisted, he ordered her stoned to death and ordered his companions to
~~respect her for her sincere repentance. jesus (pbuh), however,
~~explicitly refuted the claim that he had a kingdom on earth. when he was
~~dragged before the roman governor pontious pilate with a charge of
~~sedition he said: (john 18:36) "jesus answered, my kingdom is not of
~~this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants
~~fight, that i should not be delivered to the jews: but now is my kingdom
~~not from hence." jesus (pbuh) would not resort to lying to save his
~~skin. thus, he had no earthly kingdom. further, in john 8:1-7 we read
~~the story of the woman who was taken in adultery by the jews and brought
~~before jesus (pbuh). they were hoping to trap him by either having him
~~contradict the laws of moses (pbuh) by not stoning her, or by placing
~~him in a bad position with the roman empire by taking the law into his
~~own hands and ordering her stoned. PageV01P0330
# jesus cleverly extracted himself from this predicament by commanding
~~them: "he that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at
~~her." so the woman was set free. therefore, muhammad is like moses, but
~~jesus is unlike moses. 5) both moses and muhammad (pbut) came with a new
~~and comprehensive set of laws for their people. the law brought by
~~prophet moses was named the judaic law, and the law brought by prophet
~~muhammad was named the shari'ah. jesus (pbuh) however, as witnessed by
~~matthew, claimed to have not introduced any new laws, but to have come
~~to renew the law of moses (pbuh) and to have neither added nor
~~subtracted from it. in matthew 5:17-18 we read: "think not that i am
~~come to destroy the law, or the prophets: i am not come to destroy, but
~~to fulfill. for verily i say unto you, till heaven and earth pass, one
~~jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be
~~fulfilled." therefore, muhammad is like moses, but jesus is unlike
~~moses. 6) moses lead his people in a secret mass exodus from their
~~hometown to median in an attempt to flee the persecution of their
~~enemies. muhammad (pbut) too emigrated with his followers from their
~~home town to madinah in secret in order to flee the torture of their
~~enemies. jesus, however, never led his followers in a any sort of mass
~~exodus from their hometowns . therefore, muhammad is like moses, but
~~jesus is unlike moses. 7) moses was victorious over his enemies both
~~morally as well as physically. pharaoh was defeated by moses and all of
~~his army were drowned in the sea. PageV01P0331
# muhammad (pbuh) too met his enemies in battle and defeated them all.
~~this too was a moral as well as a physical victory. jesus (pbuh) on the
~~other hand is claimed in the bible to have been crucified by his
~~enemies. thus, his victory was only a moral one. therefore, muhammad is
~~like moses, but jesus is unlike moses. 8) both moses and muhammad (pbut)
~~died natural deaths. jesus (pbuh), is claimed by the christians to have
~~died violently on the cross. therefore, muhammad is like moses, but
~~jesus is unlike moses. 9) both moses and muhammad (pbut) lie buried in
~~the ground. jesus (pbuh), however, is claimed by the christians to abide
~~in heaven. therefore, muhammad is like moses, but jesus is unlike moses.
~~10) most christians claim that jesus (pbuh) is god. no christian or
~~muslim, however, claims that moses or muhammad (pbut) was god.
~~therefore, muhammad is like moses, but jesus is unlike moses. 11) both
~~moses and muhammad (pbuh) began their prophetic missions at the age of
~~forty. the bible tells us that jesus (pbuh) began at thirty. therefore,
~~muhammad is like moses, but jesus is unlike moses. 12) christians claim
~~that jesus (pbuh) was resurrected after his death. neither muslims nor
~~christians claim that moses or muhammad was resurrected. therefore,
~~muhammad is like moses, but jesus is unlike moses. there are many
~~additional points that could be mentioned but we will suffice with these
~~for now. PageV01P0332
# b) cannot be a jew well, is muhammad (pbuh) the only prophet who is
~~"like unto moses"? for example, what about jesus (pbuh)? well, we should
~~then notice that jesus (pbuh) was a jew, "then saith the woman of
~~samaria unto him, how is it that thou (jesus), being a jew, askest drink
~~of me, which am a woman of samaria?" john 4:9 and the bible specifically
~~denies that this awaited prophet will be a jew. we are told that in
~~deuteronomy: "and there arose not a prophet since in israel like unto
~~moses." deuteronomy 34:10 this awaited prophet, however, must be "like
~~unto thee (moses)." so he will come from outside of israel. c) is from
~~the brethren of the jews if this prophet can not be a jew, then what is
~~left? in this verse, god speaks to moses (pbuh) about the jews as a
~~racial entity. the awaited prophet is claimed to not be "from the jews"
~~or "from among themselves" but rather "from among their (the jew's)
~~brethren." who are the brethren of the jewish nation? the jews are the
~~sons jacob, the son of isaac, the son of abraham. isaac's older brother
~~was ishmael, the father of the arabs. thus, the brethren of the jewish
~~nation is the nation of the arabs. this statement is further reinforced
~~by the following definition of "brethren" in the hebrew dictionary of
~~the bible: "personification of a group of tribes who were regarded as
~~near kinsmen of the israelites." muhammad in the bible, jamal badawi, p.
~~PageV01P0333
# 16 please compare this expression with that of the qur'an: "indeed
~~allah has conferred a great favor upon the believers (muslims) when he
~~sent among them a messenger from among themselves, reciting unto them
~~his verses, purifying them and teaching them the book and wisdom;
~~although before that they were in manifest error." the noble qur'an,
~~aal-umran(3):164 there has come unto you (o muslims) a messenger from
~~among yourselves (muhammad, pbuh). it grieves him that you should
~~receive any injury or difficulty, full of concern for you, for the
~~believers [he is] full of pity, kind and merciful. the noble qur'an, al-
~~tawba(9):128 d) put my words in his mouth if we were to read the qur'an
~~we would find that it contains many verses stating "i am your lord, so
~~worship me" (al-anbia: 92, al-muminoon: 52), "verily, i am allah" (taha:
~~14, al-namil: 9, al-qasas: 30), "i am thy lord" (taha: 19). these verses
~~are not preceded by "i heard god say.....," or "and god said....," or
~~similar statements which would be the words of a man transmitting the
~~words of god, rather, their form is that of the first person who speaks
~~of himself. neither muhammad (pbuh) nor any muslim ever claimed that
~~muhammad (pbuh) was god, therefore, muhammad (pbuh) was speaking with
~~his mouth the words of god. similarly, we can find in the qur'an more
~~than four hundred verses of the form "say (o muhammad) : ........" in
~~other words god almighty is putting his words into muhammad's (pbuh)
~~mouth and commanding him to speak them. PageV01P0334
# we also find in the qur'an verses which command muhammad (pbuh) to
~~perform a certain action, such as the opening verses of al-muzzamil(73),
~~or which even go so far as to reproach muhammad (pbuh), such as the
~~chapter of al-tahreem(66) or the chapter of abasa(80). christians claim
~~that the bible has many "authors," and that while the "inspiration" is
~~from god, still, the words are those of mortal men. dr. w graham
~~scroggie of the moody bible institute, chicago, says on page 17 of his
~~book "it is human, yet divine": "...yes, the bible is human, although
~~some out of zeal which is not according to knowledge, have denied this.
~~those books have passed through the minds of men, are written in the
~~language of men, were penned by the hands of men and bear in their style
~~the characteristics of men...." kenneth cragg, the anglican bishop of
~~jerusalem, says on page 277 of his book, "the call of the minaret":
~~".....not so the new testament....... there is condensation and editing;
~~there is choice reproduction and witness. the gospels have come through
~~the mind of the church behind the authors. they represent experience and
~~history....." (both quotes have been obtained from the books of ahmed
~~deedat) the qur'an, however, is the book of god in both word and
~~meaning. an example of this is a teacher who sends two students to teach
~~what they have learned from him. the first is told to "teach them what i
~~taught you." while the second is given a ****book written by this
~~teacher and told to read verbatim from this book and say nothing of his
~~own accord. PageV01P0335
# the first will convey the thoughts of the teacher. the second will
~~convey both his thoughts and his words. sir william muir says: "there is
~~probably in the world no other book which has remained twelve centuries
~~(at the time of this quote) with so pure a ****" life of muhammad from
~~original sources, sir william muir, edinburough, j. grant, p. xxii-xxiii
~~this matter becomes clearer when studying for example the personal
~~greetings and salutations of paul and his friends at the ends of titus
~~(3:15), 2 timothy (4:19), 1 thessalonians (5:26) ..... etc. these words
~~are not the word of god but the personal greetings of paul and his
~~friends. there are many such examples to be found in the bible. the
~~qur'an contains no such verses from muhammad (pbuh). the words of
~~muhammad (pbuh) are collected in a completely separate reference from
~~the qur'an called "the sunnah" (or the "hadeeth"). we notice from all
~~this that even the church itself does not claim that the bible is the
~~actual word of god, but his "inspiration" (his teachings) through the
~~words of men. the qur'an, however, is the actual word of god. "and
~~(remember) when abraham and ishmael were raising the foundations of the
~~house (the ka'aba in makkah), [praying]: our lord! accept from us [this
~~service]. verily! you, [only you,] are the hearer, the knower. our lord!
~~and make us submissive unto you and of our offspring a nation submissive
~~unto you, and show us our ways of worship, and relent toward us. verily!
~~you, [only you,] are the relenting, the merciful. PageV01P0336
# our lord! and send among them a messenger from among them who shall
~~recite unto them your verses, and shall instruct them in the book and in
~~wisdom and shall purify them. verily! you, [only you,] are the mighty,
~~the wise. and who desires other than the path of abraham except he who
~~befools himself? truly, we chose him in this world, and verily! in the
~~hereafter he shall be among the righteous. when his lord said unto him:
~~surrender! (literally: 'be a muslim!') he said: i have surrendered
~~(literally: 'i have become a muslim') to the lord of creation." the
~~noble qur'an, al-baqarah(2):127-131 e) grave warnings for all who do not
~~follow him: so what shall we say to those who say: "jesus has redeemed
~~us. we have no need to follow any future prophets."? after the above
~~verse of deuteronomy, god himself threatens severe retribution against
~~all those who do not follow this awaited prophet. in deuteronomy we
~~read: "and it shall come to pass, [that] whosoever will not hearken unto
~~my words which he shall speak in my name, i will require [it] of him."
~~(in some translations: "i will be the revenger") deuteronomy 18:19 well,
~~do muslims read the word of god (the qur'an) in his name? the answer is:
~~yes. muhammad (pbuh) never in his lifetime claimed that the qur'an was
~~his words, but the words of god it is only the west which claims that it
~~is his words. further, when a muslim reads a verse or chapter of the
~~qur'an, you will find that they have been taught to always start their
~~recitation with the words: "in the name of god, most gracious, most
~~merciful." the qur'an contains 114 chapters. PageV01P0337
# if we were to follow them on down we would find that the first
~~chapter, second chapter, third chapter, and so on all begin with the
~~words "in the name of god, most gracious, most merciful." (there is one
~~exception). so not only muhammad (pbuh), but all muslims in general
~~recite the words of god in his name. indeed, the qur'an does even
~~confirm this same warning of deuteronomy: "and whosoever seeks other
~~than islam as their religion it will not be accepted from him, and he
~~shall be in the hereafter among those who have lost" the noble qur'an,

~~والسلام) 14- paraclete" like jesus p1 PageV01P0338
# paraclete" like jesus p1 in the bible we can find the following four
~~passages wherein jesus (pbuh) predicts a great event: john 14:16 "and i
~~will pray the father, and he shall give you another comforter, that he
~~may abide with you for ever" john 15:26 "but when the comforter is come,
~~whom i will send unto you from the father, [even] the spirit of truth,
~~which proceedeth from the father, he shall testify of me" john 14:26
~~"but the comforter, [which is] the holy ghost, whom the father will send
~~in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your
~~remembrance, whatsoever i have said unto you." john 16:7-14
~~"nevertheless i tell you the truth; it is expedient for you that i go
~~away: for if i go not away, the comforter will not come unto you; but if
~~i depart, i will send him unto you. and when he is come, he will reprove
~~the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment: of sin, because
~~they believe not on me; of righteousness, because i go to my father, and
~~ye see me no more; of judgment, because the prince of this world is
~~judged. i have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them
~~now. howbeit when he, the spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you
~~into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he
~~shall hear, [that] shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come.
~~he shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew [it]
~~unto you." in these four verses, the word "comforter" is translated from
~~the word "paraclete" ("ho parakletos" in greek). PageV01P0339
# parakletos in greek is interpreted as "an advocate", one who pleads
~~the cause of another, one who councils or advises another from deep
~~concern for the other's welfare (beacon bible commentary volume vii,
~~p.168). in these verses we are told that once jesus (pbuh) departs, a
~~paraclete will come. he will glorify jesus (pbuh), and he will guide
~~mankind into all truth. this "paraclete" is identified in john 14:26 as
~~the holy ghost. it must be pointed out that the original greek
~~manu******s speak of a "holy pneuma." the word pneuma {pnyoo'-mah} is
~~the greek root word for "spirit." there is no separate word for "ghost"
~~in the greek manu******s, of which there are claimed to be over 24,000
~~today. the translators of the king james version of the bible translate
~~this word as "ghost" to convey their own personal understanding of the
~~****. however, a more accurate translation is "holy spirit." more
~~faithful and recent translations of the bible, such as the new revised
~~standard version (nrsv), do indeed now translate it as "holy spirit."
~~this is significant, and will be expounded upon shortly. all bibles in
~~existence today are compiled from "ancient manu******s," the most
~~ancient of which being those of the fourth century c.e. any scholar of
~~the bible will tell us that no two ancient manu******s are exactly
~~identical. all bibles in our possession today are the result of
~~extensive cutting and pasting from these various manu******s with no
~~single one being the definitive reference. PageV01P0340
# what the translators of the bible have done when presented with such
~~discrepancies is to do their best to choose the correct version. in
~~other words, since they can not know which "ancient manu******" is the
~~correct one, they must do a little detective work on the **** in order
~~to decide which "version" of a given verse to accept. john 14:26 is just
~~such an example of such selection techniques. john 14:26 is the only
~~verse of the bible which associates the parakletos with the holy spirit.
~~but if we were to go back to the "ancient manu******s" themselves, we
~~would find that they are not all in agreement that the "parakletos" is
~~the holy spirit. for instance, in the famous the codex syriacus, written
~~around the fifth century c.e., and discovered in 1812 on mount sinai by
~~mrs.agnes s. lewis (and mrs. bensley), the **** of 14:26 reads;
~~"paraclete, the spirit"; and not "paraclete, the holy spirit.". is this
~~just knit picking? "spirit" or "holy spirit," what's the big deal?
~~obviously they both refer to the same thing. right? wrong! there is a
~~big difference. a "spirit," according to the language of the bible
~~simply means "a prophet" see for instance: "beloved, believe not every
~~spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of god: because many false
~~prophets are gone out into the world," 1 john 4:1-3: (also see 1 john
~~4:6), or an inspired human, for example read 1 corinthians 2:10, 2
~~thessalonians 2:2, ...etc. PageV01P0341
# we have already exhibited in chapters one and two many ********ed
~~cases of deliberate modification of the biblical **** by members of the
~~christian clergy themselves, as well as deliberate large scale projects
~~to "correct" the bible, and the writings of "the early fathers," (such
~~as the deliberate insertion of the verse of 1 john 5:7 which is now
~~universally discarded). it is, therefore, possible that either: 1) the
~~word "holy" could have been dropped by a careless copyist., or 2)
~~someone could have inserted the word "holy" to convey his personal
~~understanding of the ****. which was it? in order to arrive at the
~~answer we must follow the same path of detective work the biblical
~~scholars themselves do. we must study the characteristics of the
~~"paraclete" and compare them to both the "holy spirit" and to a
~~"spirit." muslims believe that muhammad (pbuh) was the one intended and
~~not the holy ghost. in the christian's own "gospel of barnabas" muhammad
~~is mentioned by name here. the trinitarian church, however, has done
~~it's utmost to obliterate all existing copies of "the gospel of
~~barnabas," and to hide it from the masses or to label it a forgery (see
~~chapter 7). for this reason, it becomes necessary to show that even the
~~gospels adopted by paul's church also originally spoke of muhammad
~~(pbuh). 1) christian scholars see evidence of tampering: in the famous
~~"anchor bible" we find the following quote: "the word parakletos is
~~peculiar in the nt to the johnannine literature. in john ii jesus is a
~~parakletos (not a title), serving as a heavenly intercessor with the
~~father ... PageV01P0342
# christian tradition has identified this figure (paraclete) as the holy
~~spirit, but scholars like spitta, delafosse, windisch, sasse, bultmann,
~~and betz have doubted whether this identification is true to the
~~original picture and have suggested that the paraclete was once an
~~independent salvific figure, later confused with the holy spirit." the
~~anchor bible, doubleday & company, inc, garden city, n.y. 1970, volume
~~29a, p. 1135 we are about to see some of the evidence that goes to prove
~~this position. 2) does the holy spirit "speak" or "inspire": the greek
~~word translated as "hear" in the biblical verses ("whatsoever he shall
~~hear, that shall he speak") is the greek word "akouo" {ak-oo'-o} meaning
~~to perceive sounds. it has, for instance, given us the word "acoustics,"
~~the science of sounds. similarly the verb "to speak" is the greek verb
~~"laleo" {lal-eh'-o} which has the general meaning "to emit sounds" and
~~the specific meaning "to speak." this verb occurs very frequently in the
~~greek **** of the gospels. it designates a solemn declaration by jesus
~~(pbuh) during his preachings (for example matthew 9:18). obviously these
~~verbs require hearing and speech organs in order to facilitate them.
~~there is a distinct difference between someone "inspiring" something and
~~him "speaking" something. so the paraclete will "hear" and "speak," not
~~"inspire." muhammad (pbuh), as seen above, did indeed fulfill this
~~prophesy. whatsoever he "heard" from gabriel (the qur'an), the same did
~~he physically "speak" to his followers. PageV01P0343
# in the qur'an we read: "(god swears) by the star when it falls!: your
~~comrade (muhammad) errs not, nor is he deceived; nor does he speak of
~~(his own) desire. it is naught save a revelation that is revealed (unto
~~him)." the noble qur'an, al-najm(53):1-4 3) the holy ghost was already
~~with them: in the above verses we read "if i go not away, the comforter
~~will not come unto you; but if i depart, i will send him unto you." the
~~comforter can not be the holy ghost because the holy ghost (according to
~~the bible) was "with" them already (and even quite active) long before
~~the coming of jesus (pbuh) himself and then throughout his ministry.
~~read for example. genesis 1:2 "and the earth was without form, and void;
~~and darkness [was] upon the face of the deep. and the spirit of god
~~moved upon the face of the waters." 1 samuel 10:10 "and when they came
~~thither to the hill, behold, a company of prophets met him; and the
~~spirit of god came upon him, and he prophesied among them." "and the
~~spirit of god came upon saul when he heard those tidings, and his anger
~~was kindled greatly." 1 samuel 11:6 "then he remembered the days of old,
~~moses, and his people, saying, where is he that brought them up out of
~~the sea with the shepherd of his flock? where is he that put his holy
~~spirit within him?" isaiah 63:11 "for he (john the baptist) shall be
~~great in the sight of the lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong
~~drink; and he shall be filled with the holy ghost, even from his
~~mother's womb." luke 1:15 "and the angel answered and said unto her, the
~~holy ghost shall come upon thee. PageV01P0344
# " luke 1:35 "and it came to pass, that, when elisabeth heard the
~~salutation of mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and elisabeth was
~~filled with the holy ghost" luke 1:41 "and his father zacharias was
~~filled with the holy ghost, and prophesied, saying," luke 1:67 "and,
~~behold, there was a man in jerusalem, whose name was simeon; and the
~~same man was just and devout, waiting for the consolation of israel: and
~~the holy ghost was upon him." luke 2:25 "and it was revealed unto him by
~~the holy ghost (simeon), that he should not see death, before he had
~~seen the lord's christ." luke 2:26 "and the holy ghost descended in a
~~bodily shape like a dove upon him (jesus), and a voice came from heaven,
~~which said, thou art my beloved son; in thee i am well pleased." luke
~~3:22 "then said jesus to them again, peace be unto you: as my father
~~hath sent me, even so send i you. and when he had said this, he breathed
~~on them, and saith unto them, receive ye the holy ghost." john 20:21-22
~~did they or did they not already receive the holy ghost? was jesus
~~(pbuh) not still with them when they received the holy ghost? was the
~~holy ghost not with simeon, mary, elisabeth and zacharias before the
~~birth of jesus (pbuh)? was the holy ghost not with moses (pbuh) when he
~~parted the seas? there are many more similar verses to be found in the
~~bible. in the above verses, we are told that if jesus (pbuh) does not
~~depart then the "parakletos" will not come. thus, the "holy ghost"
~~cannot be the one originally intended since it was already with them.
~~the contradiction is quite obvious. PageV01P0345
# 4) selective translation: jesus (pbuh) too is a paraclete: the word
~~"paraclete" is applied to jesus (pbuh) himself in 1 john 2:1 "my little
~~children, these things write i unto you, that ye sin not. and if any man
~~sin, we have an advocate(parakletos) with the father, jesus christ the
~~righteous." 1 john 2:1 notice how the translators have managed to
~~translate this exact same word one way (advocate) in reference to jesus
~~(pbuh) and another (comforter) with regard to the coming "parakletos."
~~why would they want to do such a thing? the reason is that the
~~translators did not want the christians, after reading "we have an
~~advocate(parakletos) with the father, jesus christ the righteous" to
~~then read "and i will pray the father, and he shall give you another
~~advocate(parakletos)." can we see why this would make them nervous?
~~well, what was jesus (pbuh)? he was a prophet! read: "...this is jesus
~~the prophet of nazareth of galilee." matthew 21:11 and "..jesus of
~~nazareth, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before god and all
~~the people" luke 24:19: ...etc. (see more in section 1.2.3.12). muhammad
~~(pbuh) was also a prophet of god. we have already demonstrate in chapter
~~one how the verses of the bible themselves prove quite conclusively that
~~jesus (pbuh) was neither a god nor part of god almighty, but an elect
~~messenger of god. the concept of his divinity was concocted by paul and
~~his ministry during the first three centuries after the departure of
~~jesus (pbuh) and is explicitly refuted by the bible itself and jesus'
~~apostles (see section 1.2.5). PageV01P0346
# 5) "another" paraclete: now go back to john 14:16 and notice the words
~~"another paraclete." if the comforter is the holy ghost then how many
~~holy ghost's are there? the word "another" is significant. we have
~~already seen how this term is applied to jesus (pbuh) himself. in
~~english, "another" may mean "one more of the same kind" or "one more of
~~a different kind." if the latter were the one intended then the current
~~christian interpretation might bear some merit. however, if "one more of
~~the same kind" was what was intended then this is positive proof that
~~the coming paraclete would be just like jesus (pbuh), a human being and
~~a prophet, not a ghost. the actual greek word used was the word "allon"
~~which is the masculine accusative form of "allos" {al'-los}: "another of
~~the same kind." the greek word for "another of a different kind" is
~~"heteros" {het'-er-os}. prof. abdul-ahad dawud (formerly rev. david
~~benjamin keldani, bishop of uramia)* says: "the adjective 'another'
~~preceding a foreign noun for the first time announced seems very strange
~~and totally superfluous. there is no doubt that the **** has been
~~tampered with and distorted." muhammad in the bible, prof. abdul-`ahad
~~dawud, p. 211 "the paraclete is a parallel figure to jesus himself; and
~~this conclusion is confirmed in the fact that the title is suitable for
~~both. it is clear from 14:16 that the source thought there were sendings
~~of two paracletes, jesus and his successor, the one following the other"
~~the gospel of john a commentary, rudolf bultmann, p. PageV01P0347
# 567 6) "parakletos" or "periklytos"?: some scholars believe that what
~~jesus (pbuh) said in his own aramaic tongue in these verses represents
~~more closely the greek word "periklytos" which means the admirable or
~~glorified one. this word corresponds exactly to the arabic word
~~"muhammad" which also means the "admired one" or "glorified one." in
~~other words, "periklytos" is "muhammad" in greek. there are several
~~similar ********ed cases of similar word substitution in the bible. it
~~is also quite possible that both words were contained in the original
~~**** but were dropped by a copyist because of the ancient custom of
~~writing words closely packed, with no spaces in-between them. in such a
~~case the original reading would have been: "and he will give you another
~~comforter(parakletos), the admirable one(periklytos)" (see examples of
~~many similar cases in the biblical **** in "the emphatic diaglott"). in
~~his book "muhammed in the bible", professor `abdul-ahad dawud, formerly
~~rev. david benjamin keldani, roman catholic bishop of uramiah, submits a
~~much more eloquent and scholarly presentation in defense of these
~~assertions, far beyond the limited abilities of this humble author. for
~~those who which to read a truly scholarly study of this matter, you may
~~obtain a copy of that book. the following is a very brief quotation from
~~that book: "the 'paraclete' does not signify either 'consoler' or
~~'advocate'; in truth, it is not a classical word at all. PageV01P0348
# the greek orthography of the word is paraklytos which in
~~ecclesiastical literature is made to mean 'one called to aid, advocate,
~~intercessor' (dict. grec.-francais, by alexandre). one need not profess
~~to be a greek scholar to know that the greek word for 'comforter or
~~consoler' is not 'paraclytos' but 'paracalon'. i have no greek version
~~of the septuagint with me, but i remember perfectly well that the hebrew
~~word for 'comforter' (mnahem) in the lamentations of jeremiah (i. 2, 9,
~~16, 17, 21, etc.) is translated into parakaloon, from the verb
~~parakaloo, which means to call to, invite, exhort, console, pray,
~~invoke. it should be noticed that there is a long alpha vowel after the
~~consonant kappa in the 'paracalon' which does not exist in the
~~'paraclytos.' in the phrase (he who consoles us in all our afflictions)
~~'paracalon' and not 'paraclytos' is used. (i exhort, or invite, thee to
~~work). many other examples can be cited here. there is another greek
~~word for comforter or consoler, i.e. "parygorytys' from 'i
~~console'.....the proper greek term for 'advocate' is sunegorus and for
~~'intercessor' or 'mediator' meditea" muhammad in the bible, prof.
~~abdul-`ahad dawud, pp. 208-209 7) "he" not "it": notice the use of "he"
~~when referring to the paraclete and not "it." if we read john 16:13, we
~~will find no less than seven occurrences of the masculine pronoun "he"
~~and "himself. PageV01P0349
# " there is not another verse in the 66 books of the protestant bible
~~or the seventy three books of the catholic bible which contains seven
~~masculine pronouns, or seven feminine pronouns, or even seven neuter
~~genders. so many masculine pronouns ill befits a ghost, holy or
~~otherwise. the word "spirit" (greek, pneu'ma), is of a neutral gender
~~and is always referred to by the pronoun "it." mr. ahmed deedat says:
~~"when this point of seven masculine pronouns was mooted by muslims in
~~india in their debates with the christian missionaries, the urdu
~~(indian) version of the bible had the pronouns presently changed to she,
~~she, she! so that the muslims could not claim that this prophecy
~~referred to muhammad (pbuh) - a man! this christian deception i have
~~seen in the bible myself. this is a common trickery by the missionaries,
~~more specially in the vernacular. the very latest ruse i have stumbled
~~across in the afrikaans bible, on the very verse under discussion; they
~~have changed the word "trooster" (comforter), to "voorspraak"
~~(mediator), and interpolated the phrase - "die heilige gees" - meaning
~~the holy ghost, which phrase no bible scholar has ever dared to
~~interpolate into any of the multifarious english versions. no, not even
~~the jehovah's witnesses. this is how the christians manufacture god's
~~word." "muhammad, the natural successor to christ," ahmed deedat, p. 51
~~8) he will guide you into all truth: in the above verses jesus (pbuh) is
~~quoted as saying "i have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot
~~bear them now. PageV01P0350
# howbeit when he, the spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into
~~all truth." what does jesus (pbuh) mean by "ye cannot bear them now"? if
~~we were to read the bible, we would find many verses throughout the
~~bible wherein jesus (pbuh) bemoans the lack of understanding he was
~~constantly greeted with from his disciples throughout his ministry: "and
~~he(jesus) saith unto them(the disciples).....o ye of little faith."
~~matthew 8:26 "...and (jesus) said unto him(peter), o thou of little
~~faith." matthew 14:31 "he (jesus) said unto them(the disciples), o ye of
~~little faith." matthew 16:8 "and he(jesus) said unto them(the
~~disciples), where is your faith?" luke 8:25 notice that these are not
~~common jews who he is saying these words to, but his own elect
~~disciples. the bible vividly illustrates how he is constantly going out
~~of his way to simplify matters for them and to speak to them as one
~~speaks to little children. however, even at that, they still
~~misunderstand. he is finally driven to frustration and made to say: "and
~~jesus said, are ye even yet without understanding?" matthew 15:16 and
~~"and jesus answering said, o faithless and perverse generation, how long
~~shall i be with you, and suffer you?" luke 9:41 we are even told that
~~his own people did not accept him: "he came unto his own, and his own
~~received him not." john 1:11 jesus (pbuh) had "all truth," but he could
~~not give it to them because they were not fit to receive it. therefore,
~~he told them that another would come after him who shall guide them into
~~"all truth" which they could not receive from him. PageV01P0351
# he tells us that the one who will come will "teach you all things."
~~this one who will guide them into "all truth" is described as "the
~~spirit of truth." we have already seen how the word "spirit" in the
~~bible is synonymous with the word "prophet." muhammad (pbuh), even
~~before he became the prophet of islam was known among his people as "al-
~~sadik al-amin," which means "the truthful, the trustworthy." thus, it
~~becomes apparent that muhammad was indeed "the spirit of truth." since
~~the departure of jesus (pbuh) and to this day, the "holy ghost" has not
~~taught mankind a single new truth not revealed by jesus (pbuh) himself.
~~it is important to notice the words "all truth" and "many things."
~~"many" and "all" means more than one. what new and innovative teachings
~~has the holy ghost given mankind which were not taught by jesus (pbuh)?
~~the qur'an says: "o mankind! the messenger (muhammad) hath come unto you
~~with the truth from your lord. therefore believe; (it is) better for
~~you. but if ye disbelieve, still, lo! unto allah belongeth whatsoever is
~~in the heavens and the earth. allah is the all-knower, the all-wise." 9)
~~he shall glorify me: the paraclete "shall glorify me" and will "testify
~~of me." muhammad (pbuh) did indeed testify of jesus (pbuh) and did
~~indeed glorify him and raise him and his mother to their well deserved
~~stations of honor and piety and even made it an article of faith for
~~every muslim to bear witness to this. PageV01P0352
# just one of the many examples of this is: "and the angles said 'o
~~mary, allah gives you glad tidings of a word from him, his name is
~~messiah, jesus son of mary, high honored in this world and the next, of
~~those near stationed to allah." the noble qur'an, a'al-umran(3):40.
~~nobody seems to recognize this fact as being at all extraordinary.
~~people generally look upon the jews as true worshippers of god and
~~followers of a legitimate faith, even if they do consider them misguided
~~by not following jesus (pbuh) but killing him. their book is even
~~incorporated into the bible as the faultless word of god. on the other
~~hand, muslims are looked down upon as followers of a false prophet and
~~as savage blood thirsty terrorists or barbarians. however, if we were to
~~look at the jewish opinion of jesus (pbuh) we would find that an early
~~reference in the babylonian "talmud" says that "jeshu ha-nocri" was a
~~false prophet who was hanged on the eve of the passover for sorcery and
~~false teaching. they further claim that he was a bastard son of a roman
~~adulterer among many other allegations. mr. josh mcdowell is a biblical
~~scholar who has researched the topic of the jewish talmud's view of
~~jesus. the talmud, of course, is the ultimate authoritative body of
~~jewish tradition, comprising the mishnah and gemara. in mr. mcdowell's
~~book, "evidence that demands a verdict," he quotes extensively from the
~~jewish talmud with regard to the official jewish view of jesus (pbuh).
~~the following is a small sampling from this book: "tol'doth yeshu. jesus
~~is referred to as 'ben pandera'. PageV01P0353
# " note: 'ben pandera' means 'son of pandera'. he was a roman soldier
~~the jews allege to have raped mary to produce the illegitimate son jesus
~~(god forbid). yeb. iv 3;49a: "rabbi shimeon ben azzai said (regarding
~~jesus): 'i found a genealogical roll in jerusalem wherein was recorded,
~~such-an-one is a bastard of an adulteress." joseph klausner adds:
~~"current editions of the mishnah, add: 'to support the words of rabbi
~~yehoshua' (who in the same mishnah says: what is a bastard? everyone
~~who's parents are liable to death by the beth din), that jesus is here
~~referred to seems to be beyond doubt." the jews had adopted in their
~~ancient references a system of referring to jesus with code names when
~~heaping upon his person allegations of evil and blasphemy. one good
~~reference on this topic is "the jewish encyclopaedia," in twelve
~~volumes. the following information is obtained from that book. under the
~~heading of "jesus in jewish legend" (vol. vii, page 170-173), we are
~~told that jesus is referred to in jewish references by such code names
~~as "that man," "that anonymous one," "yeshu," "bastard," "son of
~~pandera," "son of stada," "balaam," (destroyer of the people) etc.
~~PageV01P0354
# most allegations which are associated with jesus (peace be upon him
~~and his mother), concern themselves either with belittling the person of
~~jesus, ascribing to him illegitimate birth, ascribing to his mother mary
~~(pbuh) acts of whoredom, attributing to jesus acts of black magic
~~through the vain use of the given name of god, and attributing to him a
~~shameful death as well as severe and denigrating punishment in the
~~afterlife. these references to jesus in jewish records and law claim
~~that jesus was born to a well known adulteress named "mary," who
~~conceived him through adultery with a roman soldier who was named either
~~"pandera" or "stada." jesus is then claimed to have traveled to egypt
~~and entered into the service of magicians, he lusted after a woman and
~~was excommunicated, he set up a brick as his god and led all of israel
~~into apostasy. he is claimed to have cut his magic formulas into his
~~skin, by having taken a parchment containing the "declared name of god"
~~and cut it into his skin in order to steal it from the temple. all of
~~his miracles were then performed through this stolen parchment which was
~~later forcibly retrieved from him. it was judas iscarlot who volunteered
~~to retrieve it from jesus. an arial battle ensued between judas and
~~jesus. judas found that he could in no way touch jesus so he "defiled"
~~him. judas emerged victorious and jesus fled. forty days before the
~~condemnation of jesus, a herald called upon anyone who could say
~~anything in jesus' favor. not a single person came. PageV01P0355
# the scholars of israel then bound him to a pillar, however, his
~~disciples attacked them and freed him. he disguised himself and rode an
~~ass into jerusalem, however, judas saw through his disguise and exposed
~~him. we are told that jesus was then taken to be hung on the tree as the

~~magic and none of them would receive him. finally they hung him up on a
~~large cabbage stalk which received him. after jesus' body was placed in

~~النبي محمد عليه الصلاة والسلام في الإنجيل 15- prophet muhammad in the
~~bible? PageV01P0356
# prophet muhammad in the bible? prophet muhammad in the bible? was he
~~solomon, jesus or muhammad? muhammad's name appeared in haggai 2:7 under
~~the hebrew word mahmad ( ) which means praised one (muhammad is arabic
~~for praised one). it almost undoubtedly is referring to the arabic
~~prophet muhammad. the 5th chapter of songs of solomon is discussing
~~someone. jews will say it is discussing solomon, while christians will
~~say it is discussing jesus. considering this is the songs of solomon, it
~~would seem logical that it is discussing solomon. the verses describing
~~this mystery man have the narators speech conjuagted in the feminine
~~(meaning it is a woman who is describing this man) so it is possible
~~that it is one of solomon's wives discussing her husband (solomon).
~~however, if a christian tries to assert that jesus is being discussed,
~~then they are insinuating that this is discussing a future prophet (a
~~man who was not yet alive at that point), a prophesy.... if the 5th
~~chapter of songs of solomon is looking into the future, then there is no
~~doubt it is discussing muhammad. throughout the chapter, someone is
~~being discussed. whomever it is, verse 15 says his "countenance (face)
~~is as lebanon", so this is an arabic gentleman (or arab looking), a
~~semetic man none the less. verse 11 says "his head is as the most fine
~~gold, his locks are wavy, and black as a raven". verse 10 describes this
~~man as being "radiant and ruddy" which means he was slightly light-
~~skinned with a rosy color. PageV01P0357
# this can be confirmed in the sahih bukhari hadiths, volume 4, book 56,
~~number 747 , which says muhammad was slightly light skinned, with a rosy
~~color (and also has the same hair as is mentioned in verse 11). also
~~verse 14 describes this man as having a stomach like ivory. i take it
~~this means the parts of his body that were usually covered by his
~~garment from the sun, were very white (like ivory). this also can be
~~atributed to muhammad who although having a rosy, golden color, had
~~white armpitts (sahih bukhari, volume < http://www.usc.edu/dept/msa/fund
~~amentals/hadithsunnah/bukhari/017.sbt.html PageV01P0358
# > 2, book 17, number 141 says you could see the whites of his armpitt
~~when he raised his hand). what's the point?!?! discussing skin color,
~~and hair color is fruitless, and if i was basing it solely on that, it
~~could be describing any semetic man. however, this person's name is
~~given. in reading the english translation of songs 5:16 it finishes the
~~de******ion by saying "he is altogether lovely". the words "altogether
~~lovely" was translated from mahmad ( ). we'll take a closer look at this
~~four character word, and prove this is talking about muhammad... first
~~of all, the way this word is written is hebrew is . that happens to be
~~the exact same was muhammad's name is written in hebrew. let's look at
~~the spelling of this word... it has four characters. going from right to
~~left they are... now, when writing in hebrew, there is no difference
~~between the word mahmad ( ) and muhammad ( ). the only difference is in
~~the vowels used when pronouncing this word ( ). hebrew is an ancient
~~language, and there are no vowels. it is made up of 22 constonants. in
~~ancient times, the reader decided on his own which vowels to add in. it
~~was not until the 8th century that vowels were introduced, in the form
~~of dots and lines. however, this has nothing to do with real hebrew. the
~~word mahmad ( ) in ancient times would most likely have been pronounced
~~"mahamad". according to ben yehuda's hebrew-english dictionary, is
~~correctly pronounced "mahamad" (not mahmad) which is very close to
~~muhammad. ben yehuda's hebrew-english dictionary defines " " as "lovely,
~~coveted one, precious one, praised one". PageV01P0359
# the correct way to say "praised one" in arabic is muhammad, so this is
~~the same word! as was stated before, the name muhammad ( ) and the word
~~mahmad ( ) are spelled exactly the same way in hebrew, and both have the
~~same meaning. the only reason they are pronounced different is because
~~of vowels (dots and lines) introduced in the eigth century. the hebrew
~~word for praised one is the hebrew word for muhammad (the arabic
~~prophet) is in conclusion, if songs of solomon chapter 5 is discussing a
~~man to come after that time, it is without a doubt muhammad, as it even
~~mentions his name. any christian who believes jesus is the messiah, and
~~believes that books were sent down by god after the tanakh (old
~~testament), then surely they should take into acount what they just read
~~here, and consider the qur'an before making a decision. it is time for
~~you to be among the people whom god said: 156 - ... he (god) said: with
~~my punishment i visit whom i will; but my mercy extendeth to all things.
~~that (mercy) i shall ordain for those who do right, and practise regular
~~charity, and those who believe in our signs; 157 - those who follow the
~~messenger, the unlettered prophet, whom they find mentioned in their own
~~(******ures), in the torah and the gospel; for he commands them what is
~~just and forbids them what is evil; he allows them as lawful what is
~~good (and pure) and prohibits them from what is bad (and impure); he
~~releases them from their heavy burdens and from the yokes that are upon
~~them. PageV01P0360
# so it is those who believe in him, honor him, help him, and follow the
~~light which is sent down with him, it is they who will prosper. 158 -
~~say (o muhammad): o mankind i am sent unto you all, as the messenger of
~~god, to whom belongeth the dominion of the heavens and the earth: there
~~is no god but he: it is he that giveth both life and death. so believe
~~in god and his messenger, the unlettered prophet, who believeth in god
~~and his words: follow him that (so) ye may be guided. ultimate prophet
~~foretold by m.i. liaqath ali part 1 before commencing creation, allah
~~gathered the souls of prophets he would send down to earth and told them
~~that he gave them ******ure and wisdom; after all of them an apostle
~~(i.e. muhammad will come and confirm their ******ures and that they must
~~believe in him and help him. [al imran 3:81] as they evidently could not
~~be his contemporaries, they helped him only by saying and writing about
~~his advent, such that their posterity could have an introduction of him
~~and so trust him. prophet muhammad was commanded by god to inform that
~~he was not the only messenger of god to the world [al qur’an 46:9].

# we are presenting here some interesting information from these books
~~so that adherents to these religions (as also muslims) come to know that
~~messenger e is not alien to them, get rid of unfounded prejudices
~~against islam and the messenger and that they may take interest in the

~~qur’an 5:3] these ******ures identify the greatest prophet to come
~~mentioning details of his birth, events of his life, his followers, etc.
~~some even give his arabic name or its *****alents! this article will
~~help creating right belief (iman) in other religionists. further, it
~~will help muslims appreciate yet another facet of greatness of prophet
~~and deepen their iman. we will see here only a sample of the
~~overwhelming evidences! (a) hindu ******ures there is no doubt that god
~~sent prophets to people of india. there is no mention of any indian
~~prophet or ******ure in holy qur’an. but bukhari records prophet
~~muhammad as saying he was enjoying breeze wafting from india laden with
~~fragrance of tawhid (unity of god). the four vedas (******ures) of
~~hindus and their epics are said to be 5000-10,000 years old. they
~~contain a great deal of monotheistic ideas, and of course, prophecies on
~~h muhammad . (1) atharva veda a chapter called kuntapa sukt of atharva
~~veda is said to be very obscure in meaning and its theme, inscrutable.
~~but it readily makes sense if looked at with history of prophet .
~~PageV01P0362
# one verse as translated from sanskrit language reads; hear o people!
~~narashans will be praised. o kaurama! we got 60,090 people from our
~~enemies. the word narashans means the ‘praised one’ and the sentence
~~‘praised one will be praised’ is peculiar. here narashans is a proper
~~noun, muhammad in arabic! kaurama means emigrant muhajir that prophet
~~was. it also means spreader of peace - peace in arabic is being salam or
~~islam! 60,000+ was the population of makkah who eventually embraced
~~islam. the first line of the next verse is translated as; o chanter (or
~~praiser)! enjoy like a bird on a tree full of fruits. praiser in arabic
~~is ahmad, the other name of prophet . the verse compares beautifully
~~with the qur’anic verses 14:24,25 describing kalima tayyiba (“there is
~~no god but allah”) as a tree firmly rooted (in the earth), with branches
~~reaching to heavens, capable of bearing fruit in all seasons (i.e. the
~~world and the hereafter). the veda talks about a great sage named mamaha
~~that means; honoured or famed muhammad, again. the veda mentions a
~~mysterious set of numbers are associated with objects that the sage
~~would possess. they are simply incomprehensible. these are; 100 gold
~~coins 10 garlands, 300 horses and 10,000 cows. they can very well be
~~approximate references respectively to the first batch of mekkan
~~emigrants to abyssinia; 10 companions who were designated by prophet as
~~sure entrants to paradise; 313 companions of battle of badr and 10,000
~~companions at the invasion on makkah. (2) bhavishya puran this is a
~~sanskrit work of prophecies. PageV01P0363
# the title means ‘book of the future’. since hinduism is based in india
~~it was, and still is, taken for granted that its sages will be born in
~~india itself. contrary to this belief the book says that a great master
~~will appear in a foreign country (mlechcha acharya) and live in a sandy
~~region (marusthal). his name will be mahaaamad. within a short span of
~~18 couplets mahaamad is mentioned five times. one couplet enumerates the
~~main identification points of mahaamad’s followers; they will be
~~circumcised (unknown in india); cut hair of their heads short (as
~~against the indian practice of long uncut hair knotted into a bun), keep
~~beards call out at top voice (for prayers - azan) and will be omnivorous
~~(i.e. eat vegetarian as well as meat). the class of hindu religious
~~masters are strict vegetarians). they will be known as musalay! these
~~details will completely dispel any suspicions of coincidence in the
~~matters between mahaamad and muhammad ! there is an interesting
~~information in bhavishya purana that mahaamad would appear to bhoj,
~~ruler of dhar, and say that he would establish the religion of meat
~~eaters, by the command of ishwar i.e. god. there is a tradition that
~~long afterwards, bhoj got terrified on seeing the full moon split into
~~two. learned men consulted holy books and told him that it was one of
~~the signs of the universal master to be born in a country to the west.
~~bhoj sent his minister to prophet in arabia, who named the king
~~abdullah. the tomb of abdullah is still there at dhar. (refer fig.

# 1) (3) mahabharat this is a hindu epic describing the struggle and
~~triumph of good against evil. it was written by sage vyas who also
~~authored bhavishya purana. mahabharata says that in the last eon called
~~kali yug (in which we now live) a great sage will appear with name
~~mahaamad. he would preach about unity of god. he will be driven away
~~from his native place by his own folk. by him the world would get peace.
~~(islam means peace). mahabharat further says that cloud will provide him
~~shade. it is recorded in history that buhaira, the christian priest of
~~syria observed this sign with muhammad e in his boyhood and identified

# an avatar is considered an incarnation of god, who appears on earth

~~is substituted for ‘incarnation of god’ this de******ion will fit the
~~islamic concept of prophet . the signs and events of the final avatar
~~kalki point out to final prophet muhammad . they fit those of muhammad
~~neatly and perfectly. they are as follows; * kalki will appear in the
~~last on kali yug and will be the guide for the entire world. * he will
~~be born on the 12th day of the month. prophet as born on 12th of
~~rabiyyul awwal). * his parents will be : vishnu bhagat and soomati
~~meaning servant of god (the cherisher) and peace. (messenger’s father’s
~~name was abdullah, god’s servant and mother was amina refuge giver which
~~includes the idea of ‘peace’.) * he will be with a beauty par-
~~excellence. his body will be fragrant. * he will get wisdom on a
~~mountain. (messenger was conferred prophethood on mt.hira) * he will
~~receive a horse from god, which will be faster than lightning. riding it
~~he will go around the earth and seven skies. (during mi’raj prophet got
~~buraq meaning lightning and toured the entire universe.) kalki will
~~split the moon. like bhoj, cheraman (zamorin) perumal the ruler of
~~indian kingdom of kerala, witnessed splitting of the moon performed by
~~prophet . after gathering the facts he sailed to arabia and became
~~muslim at prophet’s hand. PageV01P0366
# his tomb is near the city of salala in oman the word ‘kalki is
~~considered to be a basic word, a noun without a meaning, as against
~~attribute - based or action - based ones. the preceding hindu books
~~either give attribute based name in sanskrit to the last prophet or
~~arabic name, which is also attribute based. the author thinks that
~~‘kalki’ is the sanskrit transliteration of the arabic ‘khalqi’ meaning
~~creation (concrete noun). he is celebrated by muslims as being; (1)
~~awwal ul khalki first of creations (2) khair il khalki best of creations
~~(3) awf al khalki foremost out of creations (4) akram al khalki greatest
~~of creations (b) buddhist ******ures buddhism is older than

~~agnostic but this is disputed. the word buddha means enlightened.
~~******ures of buddhism are available in sanskrit, pali, sinhalese,
~~burmese, chinese, tibetan and japanese languages. we could get the
~~following information collectively from them; at his death bed his
~~grief-stricken disciples asked him who will provide them guidance after
~~him. the buddha consoled them by saying; “do not think i am the only
~~buddha. there had been many before me and will be many after me.
~~(compare this with the qur’anic verse 26:9 “say (o muhammad): i am no
~~new thing among messengers (of allah....). at appropriate time a great
~~buddha will come.” * he will be born in a country to west ( and not in
~~india). remember that arabia is in the west of india. * he will migrate
~~from his homeland. PageV01P0367
# * he will look at the universe face to face. (compare this with
~~mi’raj). * his countrymen cannot be reformed until his advent. * he will
~~preach the same religion as mine but its perfection and success will
~~reach peak stage only in his time (compare this with the qur’anic verse
~~5:3 “..... i have perfected your religion for you.. . and have chosen al
~~islam for you as religion... “). * while my disciples are in hundreds,
~~his will be in thousands. the chief disciple ananda asked him how to
~~identify the great buddha when he eventually comes. gautama told them, *
~~“his name will be maitreya.” the word maitreya means love, kindness,
~~compassion, mercy, and so on. the arabic for mercy is rahmat. rahmat is
~~title given to the sayyidul mursaleen e leader of prophets, by allah in
~~qur’an ! he refers to him as; rahmatan lil alameen mercy unto the worlds
~~(21:07) rahshatun lilladeena amanu minkum mercy unto the believers
~~(9:61) rahmatan min rabbika mercy from thy lord (28:46) we can see that
~~the indian ******ures refer to the ultimate prophet ultimate both in
~~time and greatness in clear, direct terms. no stretch of imagination,
~~playing with words and linguistic nuances or involved, artificial
~~interpretations are needed to grasp the point. no complicated inductive
~~or deductive logic is required for drawing the conclusion. on the other
~~hand, the facts are recorded in a straightforward manner and are

~~foretold in parsi ******ures parsi religion or magianism was established
~~in persia in ancient times by prophet zoroaster and hence also known as
~~zoroastrianism. the suggestion by some that he was a prophet of islam
~~cannot be ascertained or denied for lack of direct evidence in qur’an
~~and hadeeth. their ******ure avezda is in zend (old persian) language
~~and foretells of the advent of prophet muhammad . the parsi religion at
~~rasoolullah’s time suffered, and still does, from two main deviations
~~tawheed (monotheism). (1) it divided good and evil between two gods -
~~god of evil was not worshipped, though (2) parsis worship fire as god’s
~~manifestation. besides avezda, dasatir is also a holy book of parsis.
~~these two give the details of the appearance of prophet of arabia in the
~~following terms; a great sage will appear in a sandy region to the west.
~~(refer fig.1) his name will be astvat-ereta or soeshyant. astvat-ereta
~~means the praised one muhammad in arabic. soeshyant means mercy to the
~~worlds, rahmat lil alameen in arabic. PageV01P0370
# at his time the parsis will abandon fire worship and will turn towards
~~a temple which will be purified by removal of idols. on conquering
~~makkah, prophet went straight to the ka’abah, the oldest ever mosque on
~~earth, and eradicated the 360 idols, reciting the qur’anic verse; “truth
~~has come and falsehood vanished. falsehood is ever bound to vanish” (al
~~qur’an 17:81). despite clear prophecies when prophet muhammad appeared
~~these three great communities of the world missed him for various
~~reasons; (1) hindus because ******ural knowledge was not disseminated
~~but kept confined to the priestly class; (2) buddhists because of
~~information barriers due to geographical distances and (3) parsis
~~because of jealousy and prejudices even though prophet and his followers
~~were in touch with persia. however, persians eventually embraced islam,
~~the prophet’s religion except for a minuscule minority. 20 to 25% of
~~people of indian subcontinent converted to prophet’s faith. conversions
~~of buddhists of asia to islam is to a much lesser degree. but due to
~~today’s information and communication revolutions and current economic
~~prominence of the arab land the message of prophet is reaching the
~~asians, and also all other peoples of the world on a much wider scale.
~~but this phenomenon is almost totally independent of the prophecies.
~~they are therefore joining the faith he preached in a fresh series of
~~waves. allahu a’lam. god alone knows the truth of everything, including
~~the above mentioned prophecies in the three major faiths. PageV01P0371
# allah willing, an article on prophecies in jewish and christian
~~******ures will follow. prophet muhammad in zoroastrian and hindu
~~******ures the following are predictions of the coming prophet muhammad
~~as mentioned in the zoroastrian and hindu ******ures are based upon
~~'abdul haq vidyarthi's research presented in muhammad in world
~~******ure. the zoroastrian ******ure: zoroastrianism, the common
~~religion of ancient persia is also known as parsi-ism, magainism, and
~~fire-worship. the religion itself finds its origins with the prophet
~~zoroaster (greek form of zarathushtra) of whom little is known.
~~zoroastrians has been commonly described as a dualistic religion, with
~~two principal gods-ahura mazda, the god of wisdom and goodness, and his
~~adversary angra mainyu, the god of evil and wickedness. additionally,
~~there are six minor deities associated with ahura mazda who are
~~manifestations of his various qualities. research into the religion and
~~early ****s have discerned the true nature of the religion. far from a
~~dualistic or polytheistic tradition, zoroastrianism, in its original
~~form, can only be considered monotheistic. farhang mehr, a zoroastrian,
~~describes his religion in the zoroastrian tradition: believing in the
~~basic tenets of monotheistic religions--the transcendence and eternity
~~of the creator, revelation, god's message, and life after death with
~~reward and punishment-zoroastrianism must be classified as a
~~monotheistic religion. the zoroastrian holy ******ures have changed over
~~time. the gathas were the original revelation, which zoroaster delivered
~~to his people. PageV01P0372
# only 5 books have survived. the ******ure was first written in gathic;
~~a dead language which is reserved for few scholars only. later priests
~~would add to the gathas, in the avestan language, to make up the rest of
~~the zoroastrian holy book, now known as the avesta (or zend avesta).
~~this book was translated by the conquering sasanids into the pahlavi
~~tongue. what survives today is estimated to be only a quarter of the
~~original 21 books of the avesta. the excerpt displayed here is from a
~~portion of the avesta known as the dadistan. the prophecy specifically
~~contained in sasan 1, verses 54-61: when such deeds the persians will
~~commit, a man from among the arabs will be born, from among the
~~followers of whom, crown and throne, and kingdom and religion of the
~~persians all shall be overthrown and dissolute. and the arrogant people
~~shall be subjugated. they will see instead of the house of idols and the
~~temple of fire, the house of worship of abraham without any idols in it;
~~the qibla. and they will be a mercy for the worlds and then they will
~~capture places of the temples of fire, madain or ctesiphon, and of the
~~surrounding places of eminence and sanctity, and their religious leader
~~will be an eloquent man and his message or what he will say will be well
~~connected. the "sum and substance" of the prophecy can be stated that
~~when the zoroastrians forsake their religion and their deeds become
~~unprincipled in ignorance, a man will arise in arabia (a prophet), whose
~~adherents will conquer the arrogant persians and overrule them.
~~PageV01P0373
# they will turn from idolatry and fire-worship to worship at the house
~~of god, the ka'ba of abraham, which will be cleansed of all idols. the
~~followers of this arabian prophet will be a "mercy onto the world." this
~~is also the title given to prophet muhammad in the qur'an. the cohorts
~~of this arab prophet will become the masters of persia, madian, tus,
~~balkh, and neighboring territories. their prophet will be eloquent in
~~speech and his message will be clear and logical (well connected). the
~~hindu ******ures the hindu religion is the predominant religion in india
~~and its influence does not pervade much further. it is a polytheistic
~~religion founded upon three main ******ures-the vedas, the upanishads,
~~and the puranas. the last of these, the puranas, are the most widely
~~read and easily found of the three sacred writs. the puranas also appear
~~to be the most authentic because their sanctity is attested to by the
~~highly revered vedas (which means they must be more ancient than the
~~vedas). the penguin dictionary of religions states that the puranas
~~"from part of the real ******ures of the hindus, in the sense that they
~~have been available to and known by low-caste people whereas the veda
~~****s were the preserve of the brahmans." we find in prati sarg parv of
~~bhavisha purana (a book from the puranas), the following passage: a
~~"malechha" [belongs to a foreign country and speaking a foreign
~~language] spiritual teacher will appear with his companions. his name
~~will be muhammad. PageV01P0374
# "raga" after giving this "maha dev arab" [arab of angelic character] a
~~bath in the panchgavya and the ganges water [and thus purging his sins]
~~offered him the presents of his sincere devotion and showing him all
~~reverence said, 'i make obeisance to thee. ' 'o ye the pride of mankind,
~~the dweller in arabia, ye have collected a great force to kill the devil
~~and you yourself have been protected from the "malechha's" opponents.'
~~'o ye! the image of the most pious god the biggest lord, i am a slave to
~~thee, take me as one lying on thy feet.' (prati sarg parv iii: 3, 3.5-8)
~~this prophecy indicates the following points: the name of the prophet is
~~clearly stated as muhammad. he is said to be from arabia. the sanskrit
~~word "marusthal" used in the prophecy means a sandy tract of land or
~~desert. special mention is made of the companions of the prophet.
~~indeed, his companions reflected many of the qualities he himself had.
~~he will be immune from sins, having an angelic character. the raja of
~~india will treat him with honor and deference. the prophet will be
~~granted protection from his enemies. he will kill the devil, root out
~~idol-worship and will do away with all sorts of vices. the maharishi
~~claims to be lying at his feet. he is regarded as the "pride of mankind"
~~(parabatis nath) we can see that both the zoroastrian and hindu
~~******ure also give faithful de******ions of prophet muhammad. the
~~revelution of the qur'an and the prophethood of muhammad are signs and
~~guidance from god for mankind as a whole. PageV01P0375
# in the qur'an, god almighty constantly refers to muhammad in universal
~~terms: "the seal of the prophethood," "mercy to all the worlds,"
~~"beginner of glad tidings" and a "messenger of god." if we compare the
~~teachings of muhammad with those of other prophetic faiths-judaism,
~~christianity and zoroastrianism, we see commonality. however, as
~~muhammad was to be the last prophet, it would only seem natural that he
~~should be universal. it is because this-that muhammad is god's
~~instrument of guidance for the world-that he has been mentioned in many
~~of the previous revelations. muhammad in hindu ******s a recently
~~published book in hindi has raised a lot of hue and cry all over india.
~~in the event of the author being a muslim, he would have been jailed and
~~a strict ban would have certainly been imposed on the printing and
~~publishing of the book. the author of this important research work
~~"kalki autar" i.e. "guide and prophet of whole universe" comes of a
~~bengali race and holds an important portfolio at ilahabad univerity.
~~pundit vaid parkash is a brahman hindu and a well known sanskrit scholar
~~and research worker. pundit vaid parkash, after a great deal of toil and
~~hard-work, presented the work to as many as eight great pundits who are
~~themselves very well known in the field of research in india, and are
~~amongst the learned religious leaders. their pundits, after thorough
~~study of the book, have acknowledged this to be true and authentic
~~research work. PageV01P0376

~~?how say they that christ david?s son? and himself saith book psalms:
~~?the lord said unto lord, sit thou on my right hand till i make shine
~~enemies thy footstool.? david therefore calleth him lord. PageV01P0382
# how he then his son?? jesus must have given an answer not recorded
~~four canonical gospels. however, it is mentioned explicitly in the
~~gospel of barnabas that the promise was made to ishmael, not to isaac.
~~david's "lord" was thus muhammad, whom he saw in spirit. no prophet ever
~~accomplished more than muhammad. even the combined work of all of the
~~other prophets remains small in comparison with that of muhammad, who,
~~during a twenty three year period, was able to leave a legacy ‹islam‹
~~that remains unchanged until now. art thou that prophet? the jews sent
~~priests and levites to john the baptist to ask who he really was. john
~~1:20-21: "and he [john the baptist] confessed and denied not; but
~~confessed, 'i am not the christ.' and they asked him: 'what then? art
~~thou elias? 'and he saith: 'i am not.' 'art thou that prophet?' and he
~~answered: 'no."' the crucial question here is: art thou that prophet?
~~who was the long awaited prophet who was to come after the advent of
~~jesus and john the baptist? was he not the one like unto moses
~~(deuteronomy 18:18) who is muhammad? baptizing with the holy ghost and
~~with fire matthew 3:1 1: "i [john the baptist] indeed baptize you with
~~water unto repentance, but he that cometh after me is mightier than i,
~~whose shoes i am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with the holy
~~ghost, and with fire." if jesus was alluded to here, john the baptist
~~would not have gone back to live in the desert again, but would have
~~clung to him and become one of his disciples, which he did not do. thus
~~john was alluding to another dowerful prophet here. PageV01P0383
# the one coming after john the baptist could not be jesus, as both were
~~contemporaries. here again, was it not prophet muhammad who was being
~~alluded to by john the baptist? the least in the kingdom of heaven jesus
~~was quoted, in matthew 11:11, as saying: "verily i say unto you. among
~~them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater man than john
~~the baptist: notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven
~~is greater than he." can you believe that john the baptist is greater
~~than adan., ng"., abraham, moses, david, and many other prophets? how
~~many pagans did john the baptist convert, and how many followers did he
~~have? but this is not the main point here. the question is: who was the
~~least in the kingdom of heaven, greater than john the baptist? for sure
~~not jesus, as at that time the kingdom of heaven was not yet formed and
~~he never claimed to be the least, i.e., the youngest one. the kingdom of
~~heaven consists of god as the supreme being and all of the prophets. the
~~least or youngest one is here prophet muhammad. blessed are the
~~peacemakers in his sermon on the mount, jesus was quoted, in matthew
~~5:9, as saying: "blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called
~~the children of god." one of the meanings of the word "islam" is peace:
~~peace between the creator and the worshiper. jesus could not mean that
~~his mission was that of a peacemaker, as he stated clearly that he had
~~not been sent for that purpose (matthew 10:34-36): "think not that i am
~~come to send peace on earth: i came not to send peace, but a sword.
~~PageV01P0384
# for i am come to set a man at variance against his father, and the
~~daughter against her mother, and the daughter-in-law against her mother-
~~in-law. and a man's foes shall be they of his own household." see also
~~luke 12:49-53. comforter john 14:16: "and i will pray the father, and he
~~shall give you another comforter, that he may abide with you for ever."
~~we do not know exactly the original aramaic word used by jesus for
~~"comforter." other bibles use "consoler," '`advocate," "helper," and in
~~greek bibles we find the word "paraclete." there are different
~~explanations for it, among them "holy spirit" and "the word. " the
~~qur'an states in surah 61:6 that jesus explicitly mentioned the name
~~ahmad: "and (remember) when jesus, son of mary, said: 'o, children of
~~israel! i am the apostle of allah (sent) to you confirming the torah
~~(which came) before me, and giving glad tidings of an apostle to come
~~after me, whose name shall be ahmad (i.e., the second name of prophet
~~muhammad, and literally it means "the one who praises allah more than
~~others")." whatever the explanation is of the comforter, we conclude
~~that jesus left an unfinished work and that someone was coming to
~~complete his mission. let us examine, in the light of the bible, if this
~~comforter fits the character of prophet muhammad: 1. "another
~~comforter": so many comforters had come, and another one was to come. 2.
~~"that he may abide with you for ever": as there was no need for another
~~one to come after him, and he was the seal of all prophets. the teaching
~~will abide for ever and will remain intact. PageV01P0385
# in fact, the qurtan and all of the teachings of prophet muhammad
~~remain as they were 1400 years ago. 3. "he will reprove the world of
~~sin": (see john 16: 8) all other prophets, even abraham, moses, david,
~~and solomon chastised their neighbors and their people for sin, but not
~~the world as muhammad did. he not only rooted out idolatry in arabia
~~within a twenty three year period, but also sent envoys to heraclius,
~~the sovereigns of the persian and roman empires, to najashi (the king of
~~ethiopia), and to muqauqis (the governor of egypt). he reprimanded the
~~christians for dividing the unity of god into three portions, for having
~~raised jesus to a son of god and then to god himself. it was he who
~~condemned the jews and christians for having corrputed their ******ures,
~~demonstrated the birthright of ishmael, and cleared the prophets from
~~accusations of adultery, incest, rape, and idolatry. 4. "the prince of
~~the world is judeed" (john 16:11). this is satan, as explained in john
~~12:31 and 14:30. so prophet muhammad came to chastise the world on
~~account of judgment. 5. "the spirit of truth" (john 16: 13). since
~~childhood, prophet muhammad was called al-amin, i.e., the honest or
~~truthful one. this person will also come and "he will guide you into all
~~truth: ..." (john 16:13). 6. "for he shall not speak of himself, but
~~whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak" (john 16:13). the qur'an
~~is god's word. not a single word from prophet muhammad or his companions
~~was included within it. the angel gabriel read it to him, he memorized
~~it, and it was written down by his scribes. PageV01P0386
# his own sayings and teachings were recorded in the hadith or (lit.
~~tradition) literature. compare this with deuteronomy 18:18: "... and
~~will put my words in his mouth; and he shall speak unto them all that i
~~shall command him." this corresponds with surah 53:2-4: "your companion
~~[muhammad] is neither astray nor being misled. nor does he speak of [his
~~own] desire. it is only the inspiration that is inspired." 7. "and he
~~will show you things to come" (john 16: 13). many prophecies of prophet
~~muhammad have already come to pass, and the rest will be fulfilled in
~~the future. 8. "he shall glorify me (john 16:14). actually, the qurtan
~~and prophet muhammad have more reverence for jesus than do the bible and
~~christians themselves. the following will clarify this point: a. to
~~believe in jesus' death on the cross discredits his prophethood,
~~according to deuteronomy 13:5: "and that prophet, or that dreamer of
~~dreams, shall be put to death ..." it also stamps him as accursed, (may
~~allah forbid it!) according to deuteronomy 21:22-23: "... for he that is
~~hanged is accursed of god . .." b. matthew 27:46: "... my god, my god,
~~why hast thou forsaken me?" would jesus have said such a thing? even a
~~non prophet would smile at agony, as he would know that his death would
~~win him the title of martyr. is this not an insult to jesus and an
~~insinuation that he did not have faith in allah? c. we muslims cannot
~~believe that jesus could label the gentiles as dogs and swine and
~~address his mother with "woman," as the qurtan states in surah 19:32:
~~"and dutiful to my mother [i.e. PageV01P0387
# mary], and [allah] made me not an unblessed and arrogant." matthew
~~7:6: "give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your
~~pearls before swine ..." john 2:4: "jesus saith unto her [mary], woman,
~~what have i to do with thee?" revelation to prophet muhammad the first
~~revelation (surah 96: 1-5) of allah through the angel gabriel to
~~muhammad was the word iqra', which means "read."as he was illiterate, he
~~replied: "i cannot read." this first revelation was prophesied in isaiah
~~29:12: "and the book is delivered to him that is not learned, saying:
~~'read this, i pray thee,' and he saith: 'i am not learned. "' the
~~qurtanic verses were not revealed in the order in which they appear in
~~the qur'an. in other words, the first part that was revealed is not the
~~first page and the last part that was revealed is not the last page.
~~that these revelations came in installments and were inserted in a
~~certain order in the qurtan as ordained by allah was also mentioned in
~~isaiah 28:10-11: "for precept must be upon precept, precept upon
~~precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a little, and there a
~~little. for with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to his
~~people." another tongue means here another language, not hebrew or
~~aramaic, but arabic. muslims all over the world use one language
~~"arabic" in calling their god, in their prayers, pilgrimage, and in
~~their greetings to each other. PageV01P0388
# this unity of language was also prophesied in zephaniah 3:9: "for then
~~will i turn to the people a pure language, that they may all call upon
~~the name of the lord, to serve him with one consent." alas the truth has
~~come in arabic, but some still expect prophet jesus, who might teach
~~mankind to worship allah in one unique language in his second coming. we
~~muslims are sure that prophet jesus, in his second coming, will join the
~~muslims in their mosques, as he is like any other muslim: he is
~~circumcised, abstains from pork, and performs prayers with ablution, and
~~that he stands, bows, and prostrates during his prayers. 16- لمن يرفض
~~سنة النبي عليه الصلاة والسلام ويكتفي بالقرآن 16- for those who deny the
~~sunnah PageV01P0389
# for those who deny the sunnah those who doubt the sunnah say that the
~~quran is preserved by the preservation of allah, as he said in the holy
~~quran : 15-9 " surely we have revealed the reminder and we will most
~~surely be its guardian." this is true,for it`s the word of allah, it`s
~~letters are firm, and the rules of reciting it is forwarded and stored
~~in the chests and the lines the holy quran is sufficient & complete,
~~allah has said : 6-38 " ... ... ... we have not neglected anything in
~~the book, ... " also he said : 16-89 " ... ... ..and we have revealed
~~the book to you explaining clearly everything ... " so why do we need
~~the sunnah for? since the quran has explained everything & is sufficient
~~. the skeptics add that the devine pledge to reserve the holy quran does
~~not include the sunnah which is the words of prophet mohammad pbuh that
~~isn`t preserved , & since prophet mohammad pbuh is a human , so he may
~~forget like any other human , & anger like any other one who may anger,
~~so how can we ******** all of his actions & worship allah with them?
~~since there`s no prove in the holy quran about them! adding that prophet
~~mohammad pbuh has cautioned by himself the danger of lying against him ,
~~in the following hadith : "let him hold his position in hell fire,he who
~~intentionally lies against me " the reply : 1- please prove your
~~assumption from the holy quran :- if the skeptics understanding of the
~~revelation of allah is true : that the quran did not abandon anything,&
~~explained everything,then they have to prove their assumption by taking
~~the quran as a sufficient and exclude the sunnah from the quran.
~~PageV01P0390
# this is the holy quran, where are the verses that tell us just to
~~count on the quran? and at the same time ask us to renounce the sunnah
~~of our prophet pbuh. we have learned this demand from the quran: 2-111 "
~~... ... ..say: bring your proof if you are truthful." & the hadith of
~~the prophet pbuh "whoever assumes something , must prove it" 2- the
~~quran & the sunnah are from the same resource : the holy quran is the
~~word of allah, revealed at once by gabriel to the lowest heaven , then
~~in sequent periods to the heart of prophet mohammad pbuh , as allah has
~~said : 53-2 " your companion does not err, nor does he go astray;" 53-3
~~" nor does he speak out of desire." 53-4 " it is naught but revelation
~~that is revealed," 53-5 " the lord of mighty power has taught him," so
~~prophet mohammad pubh does not err, & he does not speak but the truth
~~since it is reveled to him from the lord of the mighty power, the lord
~~of the heaven & the earth. PageV01P0391
# - yes, the sunnah is the words of prophet mohammad pbuh & his actions
~~, but he does not act anything out of his own desires, but by an
~~inspiration from allah , revealed to him by gabriel , & whoever reads
~~the books of sunnah & sirah (biography of prophet mohammad pbuh) would
~~notice that gabriel has descended to him in several incidents
~~–uncountable ones- to set rules or to reveal hidden facts, in the
~~following hadith which is narrated by abu-hurairah that the companions
~~of the prophet pbuh said : "o prophet of allah are you joking with us"
~~he replied :"i do not speak but what is true" - the final revelation has
~~to be preserved in order to be forwarded to people no matter what era
~~they live in, many people may mistake when they think that allah has
~~preserved only the holy quran, when he said : 15-9 " surely we have
~~revealed the reminder and we will most surely be its guardian." if it`s
~~only the holy quran then the verse would be : surely we have revealed
~~the quran and we will most surely be its guardian. so choosing the
~~"reminder" term instead of the quran is for a great wisdom, for the
~~reminder is to announce & explain everything revealed from allah
~~(including the quran & the sunnah) . * the preservation of the quran :is
~~the direct preservation by allah * the preservation of the sunnah :is by
~~the scholars of sunnah who laid down the foundations & the standards to
~~distinguish right from false hadiths or even the fabricated ones.
~~PageV01P0392
# - the reservation of this religion must include the sunnah as well,
~~since the sunnah explains the holy quran , as mentioned in al-nahl
~~chapter, this is approved by the majority of the sunnah followers. how
~~could it be possible to preserve the explained & not to preserve the
~~explainer? - if the sunnah has faced some excluded hadiths which proved
~~to be wrong ,that doesn`t mean it`s not preserved , this brutal attack
~~against the sunnah is the greatest prove for it`s preservation , if it
~~did not face such attacks , the reservation of allah would not have
~~appeared, the same as the quran , it faced many attempts of
~~modifications but allah has preserved it & preserved his prophet pbuh, &
~~revealed the plans of the wicked. allah said : 5-67 " o messenger!
~~deliver what bas been revealed to you from your lord; and if you do it
~~not, then you have not delivered his message, and allah will protect you
~~from the people; surely allah will not guide the unbelieving people." as
~~we know that many attempts to kill the prophet pbuh have failed as in
~~the case of bani al-nadheer , & the poisoned ewe , this protection of
~~allah to the prophet pbuh was not explained but with those attempts. 3-
~~the sunnah was revealed to all prophets from their lord. what kind of
~~revelation that the other prophets had? let`s try to read the following
~~verses : 33-34 " and keep to mind what is recited in your houses of the
~~revelations of allah and the wisdom; surely allah is knower of
~~subtleties, aware. PageV01P0393
# " 2-129 " our lord! and raise up in them a messenger from among them
~~who shall recite to them thy revelations and teach them the book and the
~~wisdom, and purify them; surely thou art the mighty, the wise." 2-151 "
~~even as we have sent among you a messenger from among you who recites to
~~you our revelations and purifies you and teaches you the book and the

~~is added to the book, which means that wisdom is different than the
~~book, because to add something it means that it`s different , & prophet
~~mohammad pbuh did not offer any book other than the quran which proves
~~that the wisdom is the sunnah. imam shafi`e mentioned : allah mentioned
~~the book which is the quran, & mentioned the wisdom , & i heard from
~~whom i accept of the scholars saying that the wisdom is the sunnah of
~~the prophet pbuh, & this statement is similar to the verses of the quran
~~, because the quran has mentioned the book & added the wisdom, & allah
~~has ordered the prophet pbuh to teach his followers the book & the
~~wisdom , so it`s not proper to mention that the wisdom is anything other
~~than the sunnah of the prophet pbuh . 4- if allah has said : 6-38 " ...
~~we have not neglected anything in the book.." then what do we need the
~~sunnah for ? the answer : the book in that verse does not point at the
~~quran , because if you read the whole verse : 6-38 " and there is no
~~animal that walks upon the earth nor a bird that flies with its two
~~wings but (they are) genera like yourselves; we have not neglected
~~anything in the book, then to their lord shall they be gathered." the
~~book in that verse is the tablet of records (al-lawh al-mahfouth) where

~~tablet , no sane person could ever say that the number of animals ,birds
~~& all other creatures is mentioned in the quran. PageV01P0396
# even if you think that the book in that verse means the quran, then

~~others? 2-85 " ... ... . do you then believe in a part of the book and
~~disbelieve in the other?...." 5- as for this verse : 16-89 " ... ... .
~~and we have revealed the book to you explaining clearly everything, ...

~~where in the quran the forms of worship which are considered the pillars
~~of islam? the scholars of tafsir (interpretation of the quran) all
~~agreed against this assumption: - al-awza`e said : the verse 16-89
~~refers to the sunnah. - ibn al-jawzi in zad al-maseer said : when allah
~~has said explaining everything, the scholars referred to everything of
~~the religion`s matters , in **** , or that people should learn from what
~~the prophet pbuh explained or what the majority of muslims agreed upon.
~~- al-jassas in the rules of the quran said : it means:- & allah knows

~~it`s rule: by **** or by a proof, what the prophet pbuh has explained is

~~have agreed upon is also from the book, because the book has mentioned
~~that what the majority agrees upon is right & that they don`t agree upon
~~a deception. - al-shawkani said in fat-h al-qadeer : the meaning of
~~explaining everything is that it explains many rules & what left is

~~the prophet pbuh said :"i have been given the quran & what is like it"

~~24-49 " and if the truth be on their side, they come to him quickly,
~~obedient." 24-50 " is there in their hearts a disease, or are they in

~~to ascertain his truthfulness. the jews had a prophecy that required
~~elias to come before jesus (pbuh): "elias verily cometh first" mark 9:12
~~(also john 3:28). they had not seen elias yet so they doubted the claim
~~of jesus (pbuh). jesus, however, responded to them that elias had
~~already come but that they did not recognize him. in matthew we read:
~~"but i say unto you, that elias is come already, and they knew him
~~not.........then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of
~~john the baptist." matthew 17:12-13 john, however refutes the claims of
~~jesus (pbuh). this is one of the christian's "dark sayings of jesus"
~~that their scholars have tried to reconcile for centuries. we will leave
~~this matter for them to work out among themselves (this matter is
~~resolved in the gospel of barnabas. please see chapter 7 for more). now,
~~in john we read "and this is the record of john, when the jews sent
~~priests and levites from jerusalem to ask him, who art thou? and he
~~confessed, and denied not; but confessed, i am not the christ. and they
~~asked him, what then? art thou elias? and he saith, i am not. art thou
~~that prophet? and he answered, no." john 1:19-21 we notice that there
~~are three distinct prophecies here: 1) elias, 2) jesus, 3) that prophet.
~~the jews were not waiting for two prophecies, but three. PageV01P0401
# this can be further clarified by reading john: "and they asked him,
~~and said unto him, why baptizest thou then, if thou be: a) not that
~~christ, b) nor elias, c) neither that prophet?" john 1:25 if "that
~~prophet" were jesus (pbuh) wouldn't the third question in both verses be
~~redundant? further, we must remember that "that prophet" can not apply
~~to any prophet before the time of jesus (pbuh) because at the time of
~~jesus (pbuh) the jews were still waiting for all three. notice how when
~~we let the bible speak for itself, without forcing the holy spirit or
~~other supernatural meanings on it in the commentary, or forcing three
~~questions to be only two, how clear these verses become. for much more
~~evidence in this regard, please read chapter 7 regarding the dead sea
~~scroll prophesies of "two messiahs" and how the jews who wrote the
~~scrolls and who were waiting for the coming of jesus (pbuh) clearly

~~misconception: muslims worship muhammad misconception: muslims worship
~~muhammad source: islamic awareness article id : msc010002 [5089]
~~misconception: muslims worship muhammad according to islamic belief, the
~~prophet muhammad was the last messenger of god. he, like all of god's
~~prophets and messengers - such as noah, abraham, moses and jesus -- was
~~only a human being. christians came to the mistaken assumption that
~~muslims worship muhammad by formulating an incorrect analogy - they
~~worship jesus so they assumed muslims worship muhammad. this is one of
~~the reasons that they called muslims by the incorrect name "mohammedans"
~~for so many years! muhammad, like jesus, never claimed divine status. he
~~called people to worship only almighty god, and he continually
~~emphasized his humanity so that people would not fall into the same
~~errors as christians did in regards to jesus. in order to prevent his
~~deification, the prophet muhammad always said to refer to him as "the
~~messenger of god and his slave". muhammad was chosen to be god's final
~~messenger --- to communicate the message not only in words but to be a
~~living example of the message. muslims love and respect him because he
~~was of the highest moral character and he brought the truth from god -
~~which is the pure monotheism of islam. PageV01P0404
# even when islam was in its very early stages, god revealed that
~~muhammad "was sent as a mercy to all of mankind" - thus informing us
~~that the message of islam would become very widespread. muslims strive
~~to follow the great example of muhammad, peace be upon him, but they do
~~not worship him in any way. additionally, islam teaches muslims to
~~respect all of god's prophets and messengers - but respecting and loving
~~them does not mean worshipping them. all true muslims realize that all
~~worship and prayer must be directed to almighty god alone. suffice it to
~~say that worshipping muhammad --- or anyone else --- along with almighty
~~god is considered to be the worst sin in islam. even if a person claims
~~to be muslim, but they worship and pray to other than almighty god, this
~~cancels and nullifies their islam. the declaration of faith of islam
~~makes it clear that muslims are taught only to worship god. this
~~declaration is as follows: "there is nothing divine or worthy of being
~~worshipped except for almighty god, and muhammad is the messenger and
~~servant of god". (الله سبحانه وتعالى) 1- أسماء الله الحسنى 1- the 99

~~he creates it, knowing the how of the thing and all of its conditions

~~is the way that will be. he is pardoning, capable. he is the might. he
~~is unique; the possessor of majesty and nobility. he is without
~~namesake, equal, rival, partner, son, daughter, offspring. he is the

~~squires. © muslim answers some of the biggest misconceptions that many
~~non-muslims have about islam have to do with the word "allah". for
~~various reasons, many people have come to believe that muslims worship a
~~different god than christians and jews. this is totally false, since
~~"allah" is simply the arabic word for "god" - and there is only one god.
~~let there be no doubt - muslims worship the god of noah, abraham, moses,
~~david and jesus - peace be upon them all. however, it is certainly true
~~that jews, christians and muslims all have different concepts of
~~almighty god. for example, muslims - like jews - reject the christian
~~beliefs of the trinity and the divine incarnation. this, however,
~~doesn't mean that each of these three religions worships a different god
~~- because, as we have already said, there is only one true god. judaism,
~~christianity and islam all claim to be "abrahamic faiths", and all of
~~them are also classified as "monotheistic". however, islam teaches that
~~other religions have, in one way or another, distorted and nullified a
~~pure and proper belief in almighty god by neglecting his true teachings
~~and mixing them with man-made ideas. first of all, it is important to
~~note that "allah" is the same word that arabic-speaking christians and
~~jews use for god. if you pick up an arabic bible, you will see the word
~~"allah" being used where "god" is used in english. this is because
~~"allah" is the only word in the arabic language *****alent to the
~~english word "god" with a capital "g". PageV01P0409
# additionally, the word "allah" cannot be made plural or given gender
~~(i.e. masculine or feminine), which goes hand-in-hand with the islamic
~~concept of god. because of this, and also because the qur'an, which is
~~the holy ******ure of muslims, was revealed in the arabic language, some
~~muslims use the word "allah" for "god", even when they are speaking
~~other languages. this is not unique to the word "allah", since many
~~muslims tend to use arabic words when discussing islamic issues,
~~regardless of the language which they speak. this is because the
~~universal teachings of islam - even though they have been translated in
~~every major language - have been preserved in the arabic language. it is
~~interesting to note that the aramaic word "el", which is the word for
~~god in the language that jesus spoke, is certainly more similar in sound
~~to the word "allah" than the english word "god". this also holds true
~~for the various hebrew words for god, which are "el" and "elah", and the
~~plural form "elohim". the reason for these similarities is that aramaic,
~~hebrew and arabic are all semitic languages with common origins. it
~~should also be noted that in translating the bible into english, the
~~hebrew word "el" is translated variously as "god", "god" and "angel"!
~~this imprecise language allows different translators, based on their
~~preconceived notions, to translate the word to fit their own views. the
~~arabic word "allah" presents no such difficulty or ambiguity, since it
~~is only used for almighty god alone. PageV01P0410
# additionally, in english, the only difference between "god", meaning a
~~false god, and "god", meaning the one true god, is the capital "g". in
~~the arabic alphabet, since it does not have capital letters, the word
~~for god (i.e. allah) is formed by adding the *****alent to the english
~~word "the" (al-) to the arabic word for "god/god" (ilah). so the arabic
~~word "allah" literally it means "the god" - the "al-" in arabic
~~basically serving the same function as the capital "g" in english. due
~~to the above mentioned facts, a more accurate translation of the word
~~"allah" into english might be "the one -and-only god" or "the one true
~~god". more importantly, it should also be noted that the arabic word
~~"allah" contains a deep religious message due to its root meaning and
~~origin. this is because it stems from the arabic verb ta'allaha (or
~~alaha), which means "to be worshipped". thus in arabic, the word "allah"
~~means "the one who deserves all worship". this, in a nut****l, is the
~~pure monotheistic message of islam. you see, according to islam,
~~"monotheism" is much more than simply believing in the existence of
~~"only one god" - as seemingly opposed to two, three or more. if one
~~understands the root meaning of the word "allah", this point should
~~become clear. one should understand that islam's criticism of the other
~~religions that claim to be "monotheistic" is not because they are
~~"polytheistic" in the classic sense, but because they direct various
~~forms of worship to other than almighty god. PageV01P0411
# we will discuss the meaning of worship in islam below, however, before
~~moving on it should be noted that many non-muslims are unaware of the
~~distinction between simply believing in the existence of only one god
~~and reserving all worship for him alone. many christians are painfully
~~unaware of this point, and thus you often find them asking how muslims
~~can accuse the followers of jesus, peace be upon him, of being
~~"polytheists" when they were all "monotheistic jews". first of all, it
~~should be clarified that the word "polytheist" doesn't really sound
~~right in this con****, since to many it implies simply believing in the
~~existence of more than one god. so in an islamic con****, "associators",
~~"man-worshippers" or "creature worshippers" might be more accurate and
~~appropriate terms - especially since christians believe jesus to be both
~~"100% god and 100% man", while still paying lip-service to god's
~~"oneness". however, as we're previously touched upon, what is really at
~~the root of this problem is the fact that christians - as well as the
~~members of other religions - don't really know what "monotheism" means -
~~especially in the islamic sense. all of the books, articles and papers
~~that i've read which were written by christians invariably limit
~~"monotheism" to believing in the existence of "one sovereign and creator
~~god". islam, however, teaches much more than this. suffice it to say
~~that just because someone claims to be a "monotheistic" jew, christian
~~or muslim, that doesn't keep them from falling into corrupt beliefs and
~~idolatrous practices. PageV01P0412
# many people, including some muslims, claim belief in "one god" even
~~though they've fallen into acts of idolatry. certainly, many protestants
~~accuse roman catholics of idolatrous practices in regards to the saints
~~and the virgin mary. likewise, the greek orthodox church is considered
~~"idolatrous" by many other christians because in much of their worship
~~they use icons. however, if you ask a roman catholic or a greek orthodox
~~person if god is "one", they will invariably answer: "yes!". this lip-
~~service, however, does not stop them from being "creature worshipping"
~~idolaters. the same goes for hindus, who just consider their gods to be
~~"manifestations" or "incarnations" of the one supreme god. everyone
~~should be aware of the fact that throughout the long history of the
~~"abrahamic faiths", there have people who, while believing in "one god",
~~have adopted beliefs and practices that completely nullify their claim
~~to "monotheism". this is the muslim view of christians. we're well aware
~~of the fact that they claim belief in "one god" with their lips, but
~~this doesn't mean that they don't nullify their claim in other ways.
~~this is because many people simply haven't been taught everything that
~~pure monotheism entails. from an islamic point of view, "monotheism" can
~~be nullified in many ways. for example, simply believing that it is
~~permissible to rule by western "liberal" and "democratic" laws in lieu
~~of the divinely revealed law of almighty god makes one a "polytheist".
~~PageV01P0413
# certainly, a person who does such a thing, whether jewish, christian
~~or muslim, doesn't ever believe that there is another almighty creator
~~and sovereign lord. however, for all practical purposes, such a person
~~has take another "god", whether they choose to admit it or not. in this
~~way they are associating partners with almighty god (arabic: shirk), and
~~thus become a "polytheist" in a practical sense, regardless of their
~~lip-service to "monotheism". this holds true even if the person doesn't
~~believe what they are doing is "worship". for example, roman catholics
~~who pray to the virgin mary will staunchly deny that they are
~~"worshipping" her. they instead call it "adoration" or some other
~~watered-down term. however, from an islamic point of view, what is
~~worship if not this? islam teaches that prayer and supplication are the
~~marrow of worship, so if one directs their prayers to an intermediary
~~(even if the pray is "ultimately" meant for god), then what is left of
~~worship? additionally, how can someone who believes in almighty god
~~follow man-made laws instead of god's law, without admitting that
~~they've begun worshipping other than god? do they know better than god?
~~additionally, the old testament makes it perfectly clear that making a
~~"graven image" of any created thing (not to mention ones which are
~~supposed to "represent" almighty god) is prohibited. please see exodus
~~20:4-6, leviticus 26:1 and deuteronomy 4:16, 23, 25, 5:8 and nehemiah
~~9:6 for some statements in regards to this point. PageV01P0414
# without addressing the issue that christians commonly violate the
~~unambiguous commandment not to even "make" representations of anything
~~that is in the "heavens above or on the earth beneath", these verses not
~~only teach that worshipping idols is prohibited, but also that almighty
~~god is eternally distinct from his creation and thus nothing in his
~~creation can represent him. to believe otherwise is to be a de facto
~~idol worshipper - even if one claims belief in one, and only one, "true
~~god". in exodus 20:4-6 and deuteronomy 4:16, almighty god - who is a
~~"jealous god" - makes it perfectly clear that he is distinct from his
~~creation. by giving such clear and merciful guidance to human beings,
~~god is establishing a universal and eternal truth for the benefit of
~~mankind. this eternal truth is the bedrock of religious guidance, since
~~once people begin to believe that almighty god mixes with or can be
~~represented by his creation, they can be duped into believing almost
~~anything. once someone accepts that god has become "incarnate" in his
~~creation, or that someone or something is a "manifestation" - and thus
~~representation - of him, the floodgates are open and "truth" becomes a
~~matter of subjective guesswork. once the first and most basic concept is
~~violated - regardless of how complicated and sophisticated the rationale
~~for it might be - it is very easy to fall further and further away from
~~the eternal truth of pure monotheism. PageV01P0415
# in the final analysis, it is not a question of whether god is capable
~~of becoming a man, but rather a question of whether one bases their
~~beliefs about god on clear, unambiguous and authentic guidance. once it
~~is left up to the human mind to decide what almighty god can and cannot
~~do, the stage is set for misguidance to take root. human speculation
~~about god only ends up leading to misguidance and despair, since no
~~clear conclusions can ever be reached. for example, is god capable of
~~creating an object so heavy that he is incapable of moving it? if not,
~~does that mean that he is incapable? it is because of misguided
~~questions like this that islam clearly teaches that mankind should only
~~say about god what he has said about himself. this means all of our
~~ideas about god must be based on revelation - not human speculation. in
~~short, the final prophet of islam - muhammad - was sent by almighty god
~~to preach the same pure monotheism that was practiced by noah, abraham,
~~moses, david and jesus - peace be upon them all. this pure monotheism
~~means not only believing that there is only one god in existence, but
~~realizing that he is transcedent above his creation and that all worship
~~is due to him alone. before concluding, we should probably address the
~~practice of those muslims who insist on using the arabic word "allah"
~~even when speaking english. PageV01P0416
# even though this practice certainly is not to be condemned when it is
~~done around those who understand the meaning of the arabic word "allah",
~~it is my experience - both during my years as a non-muslim and my years
~~as a muslim - that such a practice can (and usually does) breed
~~misunderstanding. it seems that often times, many of the muslims who use
~~the word "allah" in lieu of the word "god", even when trying to attract
~~people to islam, are unaware of the severe misunderstandings that many
~~non-muslims have about islam (and the distorted way which islam has been
~~portrayed in the west). insisting on using the word "allah" only fuels
~~the flames of misunderstanding - so there's no good reason to do it.
~~i've often wondered what value some muslims think that using the word
~~"allah" adds to the pure message that they are trying to convey. ( . . .
~~and i'm still waiting for an answer!) unfortunately, those muslims who
~~insist on using the word "allah" even when addressing non-muslims who
~~are unfamiliar with islam and the arabic language, do both a disservice
~~to themselves and their religion. unfortunately, this practice is
~~usually based on the false assumption - by a non-native speaker of
~~english - that the word "god" in english is incapable of expressing a
~~pure and proper belief in almighty god. this is certainly false. if
~~someone says that the english word "god" cannot be used to express the
~~pure islamic belief in tawhid, they are wrong not because they don't
~~understand tawhid, but simply because they don't understand the english
~~language. PageV01P0417
# many people who insist on using the arabic word "allah" usually don't
~~realize this, because in reality, they are not so much affirming the
~~word "allah" as they are rejecting the word "god" as unsuitable - based
~~on incorrect assumptions. for someone to assume that the word "god"
~~presupposes a certain theological point-of-view (such as the trinity) is
~~simply wrong - and that's wrong with a capital "w". to say the word
~~"god" should be rejected because it can be changed into "god", "gods" or
~~"goddess" is illogical because each of these words has a distinctive
~~meaning and a distinctive spelling - at least to someone who knows how
~~to speak english correctly. using the same logic, i can demonstrate that
~~the root letters "ktb" can be used to form the arabic words "kitab"
~~(book), "maktabah" (library), "maktab" (office) and "kaatib" (writer),
~~but does that mean that these words have the same meaning? do arabic-
~~speaking people go through life confusing libraries with writers and
~~offices with books (both in conversation and in reality)? i think not!
~~this is not to mention the fact that if the arabic "al-" was put in
~~front of these words in order to make them definite, confusion would be
~~even less likely! so the logic in both cases is the same, and this is
~~because even though the same letters are used in "god" and "god", these
~~two words have two different meanings in the english language. the
~~capital "g" implies something different than the small "g" - and anyone
~~who denies this simply doesn't know how to speak the english language.
~~PageV01P0418
# in concluding this point, it should be mentioned that arabic-speaking
~~muslims who believe in pure tawhid, arabic-speaking christians, the idol
~~worshippers of mecca and (so-called) muslims who believe in "wahdat al-
~~wujud" all use the word "allah". however, does this guarantee all of
~~them proper belief in "allah"? certainly not, because if they have a
~~corrupt concept of "allah" it doesn't matter what word they use! this
~~brings us to a more important point: it should be clearly understood
~~that what islam is primarily concerned with is correcting mankind's
~~concept of almighty god. what we are ultimately going to be held
~~accountable at the end of our life is not whether we prefer the word
~~"allah" over the word "god", but what our concept of god is. language is
~~only a side issue. a person can have an incorrect concept of god while
~~using the word "allah", and likewise a person can have a correct concept
~~of god while using the word "god". this is because both of these words
~~are equally capable of being misused and being improperly defined. as
~~we've already mentioned, using the word "allah" no more insinuates
~~belief in the unity of god than the use of the word "god" insinuates
~~belief in the trinity - or any other theological opinion. naturally,
~~when god sends a revelation to mankind through a prophet, he is going to
~~send it in a language that the people who receive it can understand and
~~relate to. almighty god makes this clear in the qur'an, when he states:
~~"never did we send a messenger except (to teach) in the language of his
~~(own) people in order to make (things) clear to them. PageV01P0419
# " (qur'an, chapter 14 - "abraham", verse 4) as muslims, we think that
~~it is unfortunate that we have to go into details on such seemingly
~~minor issues, but so many falsehoods have been heaped upon our religion,
~~that we feel that it is our duty to try to break down the barriers of
~~falsehood. this isn't always easy, since there is a lot of anti-islamic
~~literature in existence which tries to make islam look like something
~~strange and foreign to westerners. there are some people out there, who
~~are obviously not on the side of truth, that want to get people to
~~believe that "allah" is just some arabian "god", and that islam is
~~completely "other" - meaning that it has no common roots with the other
~~abrahamic religions (i.e. christianity and judaism). to say that muslims
~~worship a different "god" because they say "allah" is just as illogical
~~as saying that french people worship another god because they use the
~~word "dieu", that spanish-speaking people worship a different god
~~because they say "dios" or that the hebrews worshipped a different god
~~because they sometimes call him "yahweh". certainly, reasoning like this
~~is quite ridiculous! it should also be mentioned, that claiming that any
~~one language uses the only the correct word for god is tantamount to
~~denying the universality of god's message to mankind, which was to all
~~nations, tribes and people through various prophets who spoke different
~~languages. PageV01P0420
# before closing, we would like everyone to be aware of the fact that
~~some christian missionary organizations print english literature
~~intended to teach christians about islam which say such things as:
~~"allah is the god of the muslims" and that "muhammad came to get people
~~to believe in the god allah" - implying that "allah" is some sort of
~~false "god". however, when these same organizations print literature in
~~the arabic language, hoping to lead arabic-speaking muslims "to christ",
~~they use the word "allah" for god. it seems that if they were on the
~~side of truth, they would not have to resort to such inconsistencies.
~~and on an even more ridiculous note . . . there are also missionary
~~organizations that exceed this in ignorance (or deceit) by writing books
~~that call on muslims to give up their belief in "allah", and instead
~~worship the "lord" jesus, "the son of god". besides making it abundantly
~~clear that they are outside the community of pure monotheism, the people
~~who write such material don't even realize that if they wrote such a
~~pamphlet in arabic, it would be self-contradictory. PageV01P0421
# this is because in an arabic bible jesus is the "son of allah"! if an
~~arabic-speaking person gave up the worship of "allah", they would have
~~no god to worship, since "allah" is simply the arabic word for god!
~~before we conclude, however, we would like to ask our readers to ask
~~themselves what they think the reasons are behind all of these lies? if
~~islam was just some false religion that didn't make any sense, would so
~~many people, from western scholars to christian missionaries, have to
~~tell so many lies about it? the reason is that the ultimate truth of
~~islam stands on solid ground and its unshakable belief in the unity of
~~god is above reproach. due to this, christians can't criticize its
~~doctrines directly, but instead make up things about islam that aren't
~~true so that people lose the desire to learn more. if muslims were able
~~to present islam in the proper way to people in the west, it surely
~~might make many people reconsider and re-evaluate their own beliefs. it
~~is quite likely that christians, when they find out that there is a
~~universal religion in the world that teaches people to worship and love
~~god, while also practicing pure monotheism, would at least feel that
~~they should re-examine the basis for their own beliefs and doctrines. source

~~4- إثبات وحدانية الله وأنه لا شريك له 4- the oneness of the creator the
~~oneness of the creator. PageV01P0422
# the creator-glorified & exalted is he- identifies himeslf to us saying
~~: {"say (o muhammad):"he is allâh, (the) one. "allâh-us-samad" [allâh
~~the self-sufficient master, whom all creatures need, (he neither eats
~~nor drinks)]."he begets not, nor was he begotten. "and there is none co-
~~equal or comparable unto him."} (sûrat al-ikhlâs) it is the
~~oneness(unity) that has no *****alent, similar, or identical,which all
~~prophets & apostles proclaimed. the almighty god says: "22. had there
~~been therein (in the heavens and the earth) âlihah (gods) besides allâh,
~~then verily both would have been ruined. glorified be allâh, the lord of
~~the throne, (high is he) above all that (evil) they associate with him!"
~~( al-anbia'a) if there were many gods, the universe would have been
~~ruined. presumably, these so-called gods have free wills ,which would
~~certainly conflict concerning one creature. whenever they conflict, they
~~will fight. then,the system of the creature would be ruined ,and the
~~whole universe is created & united with a unite of system-as observed.
~~scientists & sages have provided clear proves & confutations about the
~~oneness (unity) of the almighty creator. first proof: if there was a
~~partner with god each one's need for the other would be undeniable. but,
~~god-who is absolutely perfect- doesn't need since the need is
~~imperfection. second proof: if there was a partner with god, each one
~~could either prevent the other or couldn't .if one of them could, the
~~other would be prevented & deprived. & if he was unable to prevent the
~~other, he would be deficient & imperfect. PageV01P0423
# incapacity is not a trait of god. so in both cases , it's impossible
~~that god has a partner. and it's proven that there is only one god who
~~has no partner & who is absolutely able. third proof: the existence of
~~god necessitates his absolute ability & power over all. that he can
~~defeat absolutely all which encounters him. otherwise, the lack of such
~~ability is imperfection. consequently, it's intuitive that the partner
~~is defeated, & obvious that it is impossible to be other than god the
~~only one. fourth proof: if there was a partner with god, three cases
~~wouldn't be exceeded. 1-both are capable of applying the system. 2-both
~~are incapable. 3-they are different & unequal in their capacity. if both
~~are capable, then one of them is supernumerary (unneeded). if both are
~~incapable, the both are useless. if one is capable & the other is not,
~~then the divinity is attributed to the capable & doesn't fit the other.
~~so, divinity is attributed to the powerful only god with no partner or
~~*****alent. the whole world testifies that it is created by the only
~~one. your food depends on the function of your stomach & intestines. and
~~doctors say that the function of intestines depends on the blood
~~circulation.& the latter depends on breathing & air. and good air
~~depends on plants.& plants depend on the sun.& the existence of the sun
~~depends on he existence of other planets & stars. thus,everything
~~depends –in its existence & function- on another thing,as observed that
~~the stomach is connected with the stars ,which testifies that all are
~~the creation of one god 5- لماذا خلقنا؟ PageV01P0424
# 5- why were we created? why were we created? god (allah) said in the
~~holy quran : ... i only created jinn and man to worship me. (surat adh-
~~dhariyat: 56) "why does allah want us to worship him?" now if we are to
~~look initially into revelation, to determine why was man created, there
~~is a deeper question that we should be asking before that: "why did god
~~create?". this before we even get to man because man is not the greatest
~~act of creation. allah says: "the creation of the heavens and the earth
~~is indeed greater then the creation of mankind; yet, most of mankind
~~know not." [surah ghafir, verse 57] man is not the greatest act of
~~creation, this universe is far more complex and far more magnificent
~~than man. so the issue of creation should then go to, "why did god
~~create?", as opposed to simply, "why create man?". human beings don’t
~~really create, they manipulate, because they can only "create" what
~~already exists. when we make a chair or a table, we didn’t create the
~~wood, we had to take it from a tree, we didn’t create the ****l, which
~~makes the screws etc, we had to melt down rocks and take the ****l out.
~~so we are not creating from nothing. we are manipulating things which
~~allah has already created in to different shapes and forms which are
~~useful to us. we call it "creation" but the real act of creation, is
~~creation from nothing, and this is unique to allah alone. there is
~~another aspect, besides the fact that the creation exists because allah
~~is the creator. PageV01P0425
# we can also see from what prophet mohammad pbuh has informed us, that
~~in the creation there is manifestation of allah’s attributes of mercy,
~~forgiveness, kindness etc etc. allah created man in paradise, they
~~disobeyed allah, but allah had taught them how to repent, how to turn
~~back to him and seek his forgiveness, then he would forgive them. having
~~done that, they were forgiven, adam became the first prophet, and
~~mankind was absolved of that sin. the story of adam and eve is the story
~~of human existence. human beings are given a consciousness of allah.
~~when allah created all human beings, as he states in the qur'an, he took
~~from adam (adam) all of his descendents, and made them all bear witness
~~that allah is their lord. so we are all born with that consciousness. he
~~has also given us a consciousness of what is right and what is wrong. we
~~were created in a means or a way in which allah has chosen to manifest
~~his attributes of creation, mercy, grace etc and he could have chosen
~~another one. but relative to us as human beings, we know that our
~~purpose is to worship allah. allah does not need our worship, a allah
~~didn’t need to create. when he created us to worship him, he didn’t
~~create us, out of a need for our worship, because allah has no needs. in
~~a famous hadith qudsi in which allah says; if all of you, jinn and
~~mankind, were to worship like the most righteous amongst you, it would
~~not increase the dominion of allah in any way shape or form. and if all
~~of us, jinn and mankind ... therefore when we look for the purpose of
~~worship, we have to look into man. PageV01P0426
# allah created us to worship him, because we need to worship him. it is
~~something he has given us as a means of benefiting ourselves. we are the
~~ones who benefit from it. worship has been established, fundamentally
~~for the growth, the spiritual growth of man. this growth takes place
~~through the remembrance of allah. when you look at all the different
~~aspects of worship, you will see the core of it is focused on the
~~remembrance of allah. "establish the prayer for my remembrance." allah
~~has said that he has created us to test us, to see which of us is best
~~in deeds. he is not testing us to know, in the sense that he doesn’t
~~already know, but this world is a test for us in order again that we can
~~grow spiritually. we cannot develop this spiritual characteristic of
~~generosity unless some of us have more then others and then we are
~~required to give of the wealth we have. when we give, we grow.
~~similarly, if we were not in a position where others had more then us
~~then we wouldn’t have the ability to develop the higher spiritual
~~quality of *******ment, patience, satisfaction in what allah has given
~~us. so it is all there in order to bring out the higher spiritual
~~qualities, which enable us to attain the state, which makes us suitable
~~and eligible to return to paradise. the paradise from which we were
~~created, we were created in paradise and for paradise. through our
~~choices we have left, in this life, a field of testing, where we can
~~grow to a state where we deserve paradise. the purpose of this life is
~~the worship of allah, this life is a test. PageV01P0427
# a test for us, will we worship allah, or will we forget him. this is
~~where our focus has to begin. 6- من الذي يجب أن نعبده؟ 6- whom must we
~~worship whom must we worship the submission of man to his creator is the
~~essence of islam. the name “islam” is chosen by god (allah) and not by
~~man. it is the same unifying message revealed to all the prophets and
~~messengers by allah and which they spread amongst their respective
~~nations. in its final form it was revealed to muhammad (peace & mercy of
~~allah be upon him) as a complete message to whole mankind. the lord,
~~allah, is the true and only creator that deserves to be worshipped. no
~~worship is worthy of being given to a stone, statue, a cross, a
~~triangle, khomeini, farakhan, eliajahs, malcom’s x or y, ghandi,
~~krishna, guru, buddha, mahatma, emperor, joseph smith, sun, moon (not to
~~that from korea too!), light, fire, rivers, cows, rama, temples,
~~prophets, messengers (yes! muslims do not worship muhammad-peace be upon
~~him), saints, priests, monks, movie stars, sheiks, etc.!!! all are
~~created beings or things. allah, is the name of the one true god. his
~~name is not chosen by man and does not have a number or gender. it is
~~known that allah is the name of god in aramaic, the language of our
~~beloved prophet jesus and a sister language of arabic. the name “allah”
~~has been used by all previous prophets starting with adam and by the
~~last and final prophet, muhammad (peace be upon them all). the innate
~~nature in man recognizes what is good and bad, what is true and false.
~~PageV01P0428
# it recognizes that the attributes of allah must be true, unique, and
~~all-perfect. it does not feel comfortable towards any kind of
~~degradation of his attributes not does it qualities to the creator. many
~~who became “dis******* with god” did so because of the practices of the
~~church in medieval europe and because of the claims of “god dwelling in
~~a son” and the concept of the “original sin”. however, they “escaped”
~~into worshipping a new theory called “mother nature” as well as the
~~“material” world. with the advancement of materialistic technology
~~others from different religions adopted the concept of “forgetting about
~~god” and “let us live this life and enjoy it!”, not realizing that they
~~have chosen the worship of the “original god” of rome: desire! .as a
~~result the “enjoyment” is turning to “suffering” from aids. now we can
~~see that all of this materialistic and secular progress produced a
~~spiritual vacuum that led to complex social, economical, political, and
~~psychological problems. many of those who “fled” their “religions” are
~~in search again. some try to “escape” the complexity of their daily
~~lives via various means. those who had the chance to examine the qur’an
~~and islam, proceed with a complete way of life that relates man to
~~establish a purpose for his presence on earth. this is well recognized
~~in the attributes of allah and what does he require from man. he does
~~not want man to be enslaved to any false deity: nature, drugs, lust,
~~money, other man, desire, or sex. PageV01P0429
# he provides man with the proofs that he is the one who can redeem so
~~that man can free himself from the slavery to any form of creation and
~~to turn to his creator alone. this creator has perfect attributes. he is
~~the first, nothing is before him, the ever living. to him is the final
~~return where everyone will be dealt with in the most perfect and just
~~way. he does not begot nor he is begotten. those who attribute divinity
~~to jesus forget or ignore the fact that jesus was in a mother’s womb. he
~~needed nutrition; he was born and grew up to be a man. he was trusted
~~with the gospel as a message to the children of israel: “for there is
~~one god, and one mediator (i.e. a messenger) between god and men (the
~~children of israel), the man christ jesus) (i timothy 2:5). a man-
~~messenger calling his nation not to worship him: “but in vain they do
~~worship me!” (mathew 15:9). a man who needs to eat, walk, sleed, rest,
~~etc.. cannot have divine attributes because he is in need and god
~~(allah) is self-sufficient. as far as buddhism, hinduism,
~~zoroastrianism, marxism, and capitalism, there is the devotion of
~~worshipping created being/things in one form or another. jews had
~~attributed a “nationalistic” belonging to allah. they labeled him “the
~~tribal god” for the children of israel. men and women following these
~~“religions” were born with the natural inclination of submission to
~~their creator, allah. it is their parents who had driven them into their
~~respective traditions. PageV01P0430
# however, once people are exposed to the signs of allah around them, or
~~in the qur’an or to someone who triggers their fitra (natural
~~inclination to worship allah alone), the reverting process begins and
~~that is why we see a universal spreading of islam. in the west and
~~despite tha many distortions of islam in the media, many admit that
~~islam may be the fastest growing faith. no sense of fairness can be
~~achieved without a genuine attempt to know the word of allah in the
~~qur’an and not on the 30-min-evening news. this is the real challenge
~~for those who seek the truth. man is created for a purpose: to live a
~~life in accordance with allah’s way. why not? do we posses the air we
~~breath? did we create ourselves or others? or were we ourselves the
~~creators? we are limited and weak. so is our right to ignore our creator
~~where we all need him? islam is the submission in worship to allah alone
~~and it is the essence of all the messages sent to all nations before us.
~~allah is all-just and all-wise. he does not intend confusion for his
~~creation. the religion accepted to him is the one chosen by him. its
~~essence must be one, because he is one. it is free from geographical,
~~racist, and status oriented concepts. it is perfect and it is the
~~complete way of life. all these qualities are chosen by allah in his
~~only religion: islam. its details are in in the qur’an, read it and come
~~with an open heart because none can expose better than the world of
~~allah. the qur’an was revealed to prophet muhammad. he did not author
~~it. he was unlettered. PageV01P0431

# a one more knowing "wa fawqa kulli dhi 'ilmin 'alim—a phrase
~~occurring, after a proclamation, in verse 76 of surat yusuf (joseph)
~~that resonates throughout every conference and every night. "so he
~~searched their saddle-bags before his brother's, then produced the cup
~~from his brother's bag. this is how we planned for joseph, for he could
~~not take his brother under the law of the king unless god so willed. we
~~raise in status whom we please. and over everyone endowed with knowledge
~~is one/one more knowing." in the strained hours of nightly reflections,
~~this phrase taunts, torments, and comforts you. the scholars would
~~debate whether it means that over everyone endowed with knowledge is a
~~person more knowing, or that over everyone endowed with knowledge is the
~~one who is all-knowing. the one does not exclude the other. in either
~~case, the impact upon you is the same. when it comes to knowledge, you
~~are tormented by your status, taunted by the status of others, and
~~comforted by the status of god. if you could struggle with problems of
~~your own construction, the hours of reflection would not be so strained.
~~you would control the problem and its solution. you would no longer be
~~taunted and at times baffled, by the way others think of and resolve
~~problems. if only you could filter all the problems through your own
~~unitary and individualistic perceptions, you could escape the long
~~agonizing hours of incoherence. if only you could speak to yourself — if
~~you could be the speaker and the audience, you would make perfect sense.
~~PageV01P0439
# but every morning as you emerge from your sanctuary, you are taunted
~~and tormented by the endless stream of challenges to your coherence and
~~lucidity. your convictions remain solid. it is your very lucidity that
~~is challenged. a student tells you that the only way she can afford
~~repaying her fathers debts and going to school is to objectify herself
~~every night into an item of consumption on a dance floor. she asks, how
~~is that different from the way men and women are objectified and
~~consumed every day in their corporate jobs? a woman tells you that she
~~feels objectified and consumed in her marriage. she is no longer an
~~individual with feelings and emotions, but she is simply a functional
~~role — a role that she plays without dignity or pride. doesn't that give
~~her the right to seek after one who does make her feel as an individual
~~and humanizes her dead soul? a man, after fifteen years of marriage and
~~three children, tells you that he has now found a woman who is "better
~~for his religion." she brings him closer to god than his present wife.
~~he asks, "don't i have an un*****ocal right to divorce, granted to me by
~~god?" then he adds, "as to the children — children are resilient, and
~~when they grow up they will understand." a kid has become convinced that
~~the devil has blue eyes and that on the final day all the evil ones will
~~be resurrected with blue eyes. doesn't that tell us something about the
~~worth and nature of races? another kid has become convinced that the
~~heart of islam is the khilafa (caliphate) and until there is a khilafa
~~everything is haram. PageV01P0440
# doesn't that create an unwavering duty upon all of us to focus on the
~~singular goal of re-establishing the khilafa on this earth? a woman
~~argues that what she does with her body is her business. her body is her
~~canvas; it is where she asserts and expresses herself. the man arguing
~~with her seems to think that every woman's body is his business, his
~~canvas, and his means to self-expression. life confronts you with
~~absurdities, layers of problems that demand not only clarity of thought
~~but expression. to know what is right needs only conviction, but to be
~~able to communicate what you believe to be right needs lucidity. yet,
~~lucid expression demands lucid thought, and the clarity of a thought is
~~inseparable from the clarity of the expression that communicates it.
~~knowledge belongs to god, and coherence is your duty. you carry the
~~burden of lucidity in understanding and expressing god's knowledge. the
~~infinite ability of human beings to produce absurdities only reminds you
~~of your status. over everyone endowed with knowledge is the one who is
~~more knowing. the burden of lucidity taunts and torments you. the
~~knowledge of the all-knowing comforts you. and you pray, "god, ease the
~~burdens of my heart and lift the impediments of my tongue so that they
~~may understand what i say" (20:25-8). 9- رحمة الله تعالى بالعاصين 9-
~~the mercy of allah in regard to forgiveness the mercy of allah in regard
~~to forgiveness PageV01P0441
# "o son of adam, as long as you call upon me and put your hope in me, i
~~have forgiven you for what you have done and i do not mind. o son of
~~adam, if your sins were to reach the clouds of the sky and then you
~~would seek my forgiveness, i would forgive you. o son of adam, if you
~~were to come to me with sins that are close to filling the earth and
~~then you would meet me without ascribing any partners with me, i would
~~certainly bring to you forgiveness close to filling it." in this hadithi
~~qudsi, allah gives hope to mankind more than any other narration. it
~~displays the quality and attribute of allahs mercy. indeed, he is ar-
~~rahman, the most compassionate, and ar-raheem, the most merciful. in
~~this hadithi qudsi, allah tells man of the greatness of his forgiveness
~~and mercy so that no one would despair due to the amount of sins he may
~~have committed. this is supported by the following verse of the holy
~~quran: say: o my servants who have transgressed against their own souls,
~~despair not of the mercy of allah. indeed, allah forgives all sins.
~~truly, he is most forgiving, most merciful. (surah az-zumar 39:53) this
~~hadith teaches us the importance of realizing allahs mercy, having faith
~~and hope in him especially when making dua, calling to allah alone for
~~forgiveness, and the importance of repentance in the life and faith of a
~~believer. allah catches the attention of mankind by calling out, o son
~~of adam! this is a call to every human being. PageV01P0442
# why didnt allah say, o mankind or o people? the significance of this
~~specific call is because it was the first human being, adam (alaiyhis-
~~salam) who committed the first sin. adam was an example to all humans of
~~the consequences of sin and how to turn to allah for forgiveness of ones
~~sins. this gives hope that even after committing a violation, ones sins
~~can be forgiven if one repents to allah sincerely the same way that the
~~father of mankind sinned, repented, and was forgiven by allah. allah
~~calls out to his servants, a call of forgiveness, mercy, and compassion.
~~for he knows that man was created weak and is prone to fall into sin.
~~after calling out to mankind, allah informs them that as long as they
~~call on him and put their hope in him, he will forgive them and not
~~mind. this statement alone can convince one to have hope and never to
~~despair. when one calls out to allah or makes dua, he is displaying his
~~need and dependence of allah. he is demonstrating his weakness to the
~~fact that he has no power to do anything for himself. it is the essence
~~of submission and servitude. it is also a recognition of allahs
~~attributes of kindness, generosity, forgiving and merciful nature, and
~~his unlimited power and knowledge. humans are never in a situation where
~~they are not in need of allah. a believer always turns to allah to ask
~~for guidance as well as to seek forgiveness of sins and shortcomings.
~~allahs says, call on me and i will respond to you. one of the most
~~important conditions of making dua is that one must completely trust
~~that allah will respond. PageV01P0443
# one must also supplicate with sincerity, hope, and seriousness. one
~~must not have any doubt at all on whether allah will respond to ones
~~call or if he accepts the dua. the messenger of allah (sallallahu
~~alaiyhi wa sallam) said, supplicate allah while you are certain of a
~~response. and know that allah does not respond to a supplication from a
~~heart that is heedless and inattentive. he also forbade that one say, oh
~~allah, forgive me if you will. but he said, instead, you should ask with
~~will and conviction for there is nothing so great to allah that he
~~cannot grant it. when supplicating, one should truly seek allahs aid and
~~his forgiveness and demonstrate his need for allah and submit to him
~~with fear and hope in receiving the desired response. allah advises in
~~surat al-araaf 7:56: and invoke him in fear and aspiration (of hope).
~~indeed, the mercy of allah is near to those who do good. another
~~important condition of supplication is that one must not become hasty
~~and impatient and stop supplicating because he did not receive a
~~response sooner or at all. the prophet (sallallahu alaiyhi wa sallam)
~~said, you are responded to as long as you do not become hasty and say, i
~~supplicated and it is not being or was not responded to. and the final
~~condition of ones dua being responded to is that one must make sure he
~~is living off of halal and permissible means. allah says, put your hope
~~in me. man was not created sinful, but he was created weak. PageV01P0444
# he is prone to fall into the temptations of sin and the whispers of
~~satan and when he does, he should always remember to turn to allah, call
~~upon him, and ask for forgiveness with hope in his mercy. allah stated
~~in a hadithi qudsi, i am with my servant as he expects of me. the
~~meaning of this is that allah treats his servants the way he expects him
~~to. if one has hope in allah and trusts him, allah will act accordingly
~~to that servants beliefs and faith. and if he does not have faith and is
~~in despair of his lords mercy, allah will act accordingly. not having
~~hope in allah and despairing of his mercy is a great sin and an act of
~~kufr. allah quotes prophet yaqoob (alaiyhis-salam) in the quran: indeed,
~~no one despairs of relief from allah except the disbelieving people.
~~(surah yusuf 12:87) one must be hopeful of allahs mercy and forgiveness
~~and fearful of his punishment. it is this fear that should lead one to
~~seek allahs forgiveness with hope. allah says: know that allah is severe
~~in punishment and that allah is forgiving and merciful. (surat al-
~~maaidah 5:98) in the above verse, allah gives us reason to fear because
~~his punishment is justly severe, as well as good reason to have hope,
~~since he is the most forgiving and merciful. there should be a balance
~~between fear and hope and not too much or too less of one or the other.
~~if there is too much fear, then a person may negate allahs quality of
~~mercy and ascribe to him unkindness (allah forbid!). PageV01P0445
# there was a sect called khawaarij, who worshipped allah only in fear
~~and held the belief that anyone who commits major sins was a disbeliever
~~and would be thrown into the hellfire forever. this is a gross extremism
~~and straying from the correct path. yet, another sect, which emerged
~~within the first century of islam, had no fear and believed that sins
~~did not affect ones faith and that as long as one believed and testified
~~in islam, he would enter paradise regardless of his actions. both of
~~these extremes lead to a dangerous consequence. to understand the
~~balance of fear and hope of allah, let us look at the very first chapter
~~of the quran, surat al-fatiha. the first verse says, all praise be to
~~allah, lord of all the worlds. in this verse, love for allah is
~~expressed. we acknowledge that allah is our lord and the lord of all the
~~worlds. he is the creator of all things; he sustains and nourishes
~~everything; he gives life and death; anything good that we have is from
~~him; and everything is dependant on him and nothing can happen unless
~~allah wills it to happen. in the second verse we express our hope in him
~~by stating, ar-rahma-nir-raheem. the meaning of which is: the
~~beneficent, the merciful. when we mention these two names of allah, then
~~we have hope, since he is the one, who is full of mercy and we hope he
~~will forgive out mistakes and shortcomings. we should never lose hope
~~because there is no reason to. and in the third ayah of surat al-fatiha,
~~fear of allah is expressed when we recite, master (king) of the day of
~~judgement. PageV01P0446
# when we recite this verse, we remind ourselves of the day that we will
~~be standing in front of our lord and be questioned for our deeds, a most
~~awful day. it will be a day in which not even the smallest action will
~~be hidden. this reminder of the day of judgement should bring fear to
~~our hearts. fear and hope, both should be equally proportioned in our
~~hearts, in our worship, and in our dua to allah. allah says: call out to
~~him with fear and hope. (surat al-araaf 7:56) they forsake their beds to
~~call their lord in fear and hope. (surat as-sajdah 32:16) the prophet
~~(sallallahu alaiyhi wa sallam) said, the like of these two qualities do
~~not unite in the heart of a servant except that allah gives him what he
~~hopes for and protects him from what he feared. in the hadithi qudsi
~~that is being discussed in this paper, allah says, o son of adam, if
~~your sins were to reach the clouds of the sky and you would then seek my
~~forgiveness, i would forgive you. here, we will discuss the importance
~~of repentance and seeking forgiveness and its virtues. first of all, we
~~should never lose hope or stop asking for allahs forgiveness. its
~~importance is shown to us in the following hadith of the prophet
~~(sallallahu alaiyhi wa sallam): o people! turn to allah in repentance
~~and seek his forgiveness, for surely i make repentance a hundred times
~~every day. repentance is such a great act of worship that doing it can
~~totally erase ones sins altogether, as the noble prophet (sallallahu
~~alaiyhi wa sallam) said, one who repents from sins is like one without
~~sin. PageV01P0447
# when a person sins and then sincerely turns to allah for forgiveness,
~~one will find allah ready to accept his repentance and to forgive him,
~~as this verse indicates: and whoever does a wrong or wrongs himself, but
~~then seeks forgiveness from allah, he will find allah forgiving and
~~merciful. (surat an-nisaa 4:110) everyone commits sin and does wrong,
~~but allah is always willing to forgive and he always gives them a chance
~~to repent and seek his forgiveness. a believer should never forget the
~~fact that allah is so forgiving. if allah had willed, he could have held
~~everyone accountable for his or her sins, but he has decreed that he
~~shall allow his servants to seek his forgiveness and that he shall in
~~fact forgive who and what he wills. in fact, allah commands that his
~~servants seek his forgiveness: and seek allahs forgiveness. certainly,
~~allah is forgiving, merciful. (surat al-muzzammil 73:20) repentance is
~~an act, which purifies the soul and brings the servant closer to his
~~lord. it puts the heart at rest from guilt. it protects one from falling
~~prey to his desires and lusts and increases his faith. allah then says
~~in the hadithi qudsi that is being discussed, o son of adam, if you were
~~to come to me with sins close to filling the earth and then you would
~~meet me without ascribing any partners with me, i would certainly bring
~~you forgiveness close to filling it. look at how great allahs mercy,
~~compassion, and love is! the least allah asks for is that one not
~~ascribe any partners and gods with him, for, he is alone in his
~~sovereignty. PageV01P0448
# and after that if one commits sins and seeks sincere forgiveness,
~~allah will forgive him and shower his mercy upon him. however, one is
~~not forgiven if he seeks repentance from allah at the time of death when
~~he sees the angels or when the sun rises from the west at the
~~approaching of the day of judgement. this is confirmed by the following
~~verse: and of no effect is the repentance of those who continue to do
~~evil deeds until death faces one of them and he says, now i repent, nor
~~of those who dies while they are disbelievers. for them, we have
~~prepared a painful torment. (surat an-nisaa 4:18) allah also does not
~~forgive one who commits shirk, which is the association of partners with
~~allah. forgiveness will only come to those who die while adhering to
~~tawheed and avoiding any form of shirk. verily, allah does not forgive
~~that partners should be set up with him, but he forgives whatever is
~~less than that for whomever he wills. and whoever sets up partners with
~~allah has indeed invented a tremendous sin. (surat an-nisaa 4:48)
~~verily, allah forgives not the setting up of partners with him, but he
~~forgives whom he pleases whatever is less than that. and whoever sets up
~~partners with allah has indeed strayed far away. (surat an-nisaa 4:116)
~~we must ask ourselves this question: would we be willing to forgive
~~anyone who hurts us and disobeys us constantly as easily as allah is
~~able to forgive? most probably, the answer would be no. but our creator
~~is the most kind and he is the most perfect. lo! allah is a lord of
~~kindness to mankind, but most of mankind give not thanks. PageV01P0449
# (surat al-baqarah 2:143) in this hadithi qudsi, mankind is encouraged
~~to seek allahs forgiveness and repent, but there are five conditions of
~~repentance, which must be met for ones repentance to be accepted. the
~~first and most important is that the act of repentance be sincerely for
~~allah alone. secondly, the person must feel remorse and guilt over his
~~actions so much so that he wished he had never done it in the first
~~place. the third condition is that the person must immediately cease
~~performing the wrong and sinful act. fourthly, the repentant person must
~~have a firm intention to never commit the sin again. and lastly, the
~~person must repent before it is too late, meaning before death
~~approaches. allah, blessed and exalted, finishes the hadithi qudsi with
~~the following words, o son of adam! if you were to come to me with sins
~~that are close to filling the earth and you would then meet me without
~~ascribing any partners to me, i would certainly bring to you forgiveness
~~close to filling it. again, the mercy of allah is clearly demonstrated
~~by his divine words. however, there is a condition. one must not
~~associate any partners with allah, which is shirk. and allah does not
~~forgive shirk and if one dies without believing in allah alone as ones
~~creator, then he will be doomed to the hellfire for all of eternity. so,
~~allah emphasizes the importance of calling on him alone. he has no and
~~needs no partners, associates, wives, children, etc. there is no god,
~~but allah. none forgives sins except him, so one seeking forgiveness
~~should seek it only from allah. PageV01P0450
# will they not repent to allah and ask his forgiveness? for allah is
~~the forgiving, the merciful. (surat al-maaidah 5:74) and who can forgive
~~sins except allah? (surah ali imran 3:135) allah praises the one who
~~truly believes, has hope, and seeks the forgiveness of his creator, as
~~did his father, adam: say: shall i not inform you of things far better
~~than those (things of this world)? for the pious, there are gardens with
~~their lord, wherein rivers flow. therein (is their) eternal home and
~~pure wives. and allah will be pleased with them. and allah is seer of
~~the slaves. those who say, our lord! we have indeed believed, so forgive
~~us our sins and save us from the punishment of the fire. they are those
~~who are patient, those who are true and obedient with sincere devotion
~~in worship to allah. those who spend (in charity) and those who pray and
~~beg for allahs forgiveness in the last hours of the night. (surah ali
~~imran 3:15-17) allahs forgiveness and mercy is far greater and more vast
~~than the sins of the creation. one must always have trust and hope in
~~allah in both good times and bad times and especially when seeking
~~allahs forgiveness. and the believer who calls out to his lord for
~~forgiveness demonstrates his true weakness and that he is totally
~~dependent on the creator. when one confesses his sins to allah and
~~sincerely repents with hope in allahs mercy, the heart should come to
~~peace and the soul should feel rest. when a person has hope, he has no
~~reason to despair because it only leads to destruction. PageV01P0451
# allah gives hope to all, especially those who despair that there is no
~~reason to despair because allah is the most merciful of all those who
~~show mercy. allah praises those who repent and turn to him: and those
~~who, when they commit a lewd act or wrong themselves with evil, remember
~~allah and ask forgiveness for their sinsand who forgives sins except
~~allah? and they do not persist in what (wrong) they were doing while
~~they knew it. for such, the reward is forgiveness from their lord and
~~gardens with rivers flowing through, wherein they shall abide forever.
~~how excellent is the reward of the doers (of good)! (surah ali imran

# concept of god in islam wamy series: on islam no.9. introduction god's
~~attributes the oneness of god the believer's attitude introduction it is
~~a known fact that every language has one or more terms that are used in
~~reference to god and sometimes to lesser deities. this is not the case
~~with allah. allah is the personal name of the one true god. nothing else
~~can be called allah. the term has no plural or gender. this shows its
~~uniqueness when compared with the word "god," which can be made plural,
~~as in "gods," or made feminine, as in "goddess." it is interesting to
~~notice that allah is the personal name of god in aramaic, the language
~~of jesus and a sister language of arabic. the one true god is a
~~reflection of the unique concept that islam associates with god. to a
~~muslim, allah is the almighty creator and sustainer of the universe, who
~~is similar to nothing, and nothing is comparable to him. the prophet
~~muhammad was asked by his contemporaries about allah; the answer came
~~directly from god himself in the form of a short chapter of the qur'an,
~~which is considered to be the essence of the unity or the motto of
~~monotheism. this is chapter 112, which reads:“ in the name of allah, the
~~merciful, the compassionate. say (o muhammad), he is god, the one god,
~~the everlasting refuge, who has not begotten, nor has been begotten, and
~~equal to him is not anyone”. some non-muslims allege that god in islam
~~is a stern and cruel god who demands to be obeyed fully and is not
~~loving and kind. nothing could be farther from the truth than this
~~allegation. PageV01P0453
# it is enough to know that, with the exception of one, each of the 114
~~chapters of the qur'an begins with the verse " in the name of god, the
~~merciful, the compassionate". in one of the sayings of prophet muhammad
~~(pbuh), we are told that “ god is more loving and kind than a mother to
~~her dear child”. on the other hand, god is also just. hence, evildoers
~~and sinners must have their share of punishment, and the virtuous must
~~have god's bounties and favors. actually, god's attribute of mercy has
~~full manifestation in his attribute of justice. people suffering
~~throughout their lives for his sake should not receive similar treatment
~~from their lord as people who oppress and exploit others their whole
~~lives. expecting similar treatment for them would amount to negating the
~~very belief in the accountability of man in the hereafter and thereby
~~negate all the incentives for a moral and virtuous life in this world.
~~the following qur'anic verses are very clear and straightforward in this
~~respect. verily, for the righteous are gardens of delight, in the
~~presence of their lord. shall we then treat the people of faith like the
~~people of sin? what is the matter with you? how judge you? islam rejects
~~characterizing god in any human form or depicting him as favoring
~~certain individuals or nations on the basis of wealth, power or race. he
~~created the human-beings as equals. they may distinguish themselves and
~~get his favor through virtue and piety only. PageV01P0454
# the concepts that god rested on the seventh day of creation, that god
~~wrestled with one of his soldiers, that god is an envious plotter
~~against mankind, and that god is incarnate in any human being are
~~considered blasphemy from the islamic point of view. the unique usage of
~~allah as a personal name of god is a reflection of islam's emphasis on
~~the purity of the belief in god that is the essence of the message of
~~all god's messengers. because of this, islam considers associating any
~~deity or personality with god as a deadly sin that god will never
~~forgive, despite the fact that he may forgive all other sins. the
~~creator must be of a different nature from the things created because if
~~he is of the same nature as they are, he will be temporal and will
~~therefore need a maker. it follows that nothing is like him. if the
~~maker is not temporal, then he must be eternal. but if he is eternal, he
~~cannot be caused, and if nothing caused him to come into existence,
~~nothing outside him causes him to continue to exist, which means that he
~~must be self-sufficient. and if he does not depend on anything for the
~~continuance of his own existence, then this existence can have no end.
~~the creator is therefore eternal and everlasting: "he is the first and
~~the last". he is self-sufficient or self-subsistent, or, to use a
~~qur'anic term, al-qayyum the creator does not create only in the sense
~~of bringing things into being, he. also preserves them and takes them
~~out of existence and is the ultimate cause of whatever happens to them.
~~“ god is the creator of everything. PageV01P0455
# he is the guardian over everything. unto him belong the keys of the
~~heavens and the earth” (39:62-63). “ no creature is there crawling on
~~the earth, but its provision rests on god. he knows its lodging place
~~and its repository” (11:16). god's attributes if the creator is eternal
~~and everlasting, then his attributes must also be eternal and
~~everlasting. he should not lose any of his attributes nor acquire new
~~ones. if this is so, then his attributes are absolute. can there be more
~~than one creator with such absolute attributes? can there be, for
~~example, two absolutely powerful creators? a moment's thought shows that
~~this is not feasible. the qur'an summarizes this argument in the
~~following verses:“ god has not taken to himself any son, nor is there
~~any god with him: for then each god would have taken of that which he
~~created and some of them would have risen up over others” (23:91). “ and
~~why, were there gods in earth and heaven other than god, they (heaven
~~and earth) would surely go to ruin” (21:22). the oneness of god the
~~qur'an reminds us of the falsity of all alleged gods. to the worshippers
~~of man-made objects it asks:“ do you worship what you have carved
~~yourself” (37:95). “ or have you taken unto yourself others beside him
~~to be your protectors, even such as have no power either for good or for
~~harm to themselves” (13:16). to the worshippers of heavenly bodies it
~~cites the story of abraham:“ when night outspread over him, he saw a
~~star and said: this is my lord. but when it set, he said: i love not the
~~setters. when he saw the moon rising, he said: this is my lord.
~~PageV01P0456
# but when it set, he said: if my lord does not guide me, i shall surely
~~be of the people gone astray. when he saw the sun rising, he said: this
~~is my lord; this is greater. but when it set, he said: o my people,
~~surely i quit that which you associate, i have turned my face to him who
~~originated the heavens and the earth; a man of pure faith, i am not one
~~of the idolators” (6:76-79). the believer's attitude in order to be a
~~muslim, that is, to surrender oneself to god, it is necessary to believe
~~in the oneness of god, in the sense of his being the only creator,
~~preserver, nourisher, etc. but this belief, later called tawhid ar-
~~rububiyyah, is not enough. many of the idolators knew and believed that
~~only the supreme god could do all this. but this was not enough to make
~~them muslims. to tawhid ar-rububiyyah, one must add tawhid
~~al-'uluhiyyah. that is, one acknowledges the fact that it is god alone
~~who deserves to be worshipped, and thus abstains from worshipping any
~~other thing or being. having achieved this knowledge of the one true
~~god, man should constantly have faith in him, and should allow nothing
~~to induce him to deny truth. when faith enters a person's heart, it
~~causes certain mental states that result in certain actions. taken
~~together, these mental states and actions are the proof for the true
~~faith. the prophet said:“ faith is that which resides firmly in the
~~heart and which is proved by deeds”. foremost among those mental stated
~~is the feeling of gratitude towards god, which could be said to be the
~~essence of ibada (worship). PageV01P0457
# the feeling of gratitude is so important that a non-believer is called
~~'kafir', which means 'one who denies a truth' and also 'one who is
~~ungrateful'. a believer loves, and is grateful to god for the bounties
~~he bestowed upon him, but being aware of the fact that his good deeds,
~~whether mental or physical, are far from being commensurate with divine
~~favors, he is always anxious lest god should punish him, here or in the
~~hereafter. he, therefore, fears him, surrenders himself to him and
~~serves him with great humility. one cannot be in such a mental state
~~without being almost all the time mindful of god. remembering god is
~~thus the life force of faith, without which it fades and withers away.
~~the qur'an tries to promote this feeling of gratitude by repeating the
~~attributes of god very frequently. we find most of these attributes
~~mentioned together in the following verses of the qur'an:“ he is god;
~~there is no god but he. he is the knower of the unseen and the visible;
~~he is the all-merciful, the all-compassionate. he is god; there is no
~~god but he. he is the king, the all-holy, the all-peace, the guardian of
~~the faith, the all-preserver, the all-mighty, the all-compeller, the
~~all-sublime. glory be to god, above that they associate! he is god, the
~~creator, the maker, the shaper. to him belong the names most beautiful.
~~all that is in the heavens and the earth magnifies him; he is the
~~almighty, the all-wise” (59:22-24). “ there is no god but he, the
~~living, the everlasting. slumber seizes him not, nor sleep. to him
~~belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth. PageV01P0458
# who is there that shall intercede with him save by his leave? he knows
~~what lies before them, and what is after them, and they comprehend not
~~anything of his knowledge save such as he wills. his throne comprises
~~the heavens and earth. the preserving of them oppresses him not; he is
~~the all-high, the all-glorious” (2:255). people of the book, go not
~~beyond the bounds in your religion, and say not as to god but the truth.
~~“ the messiah, jesus, son of mary, was only the messenger of god, and
~~his word that he committed to mary, and a spirit from him. so believe in
~~god and his messengers, and say not "three". refrain; better it is for
~~you. god is only one god. glory be to him -- (he is) above having a son”
~~(4:171). 11- رد شبهة أصل اسم "الله" إله القمر 11- archeology tells us

~~comment:- here is a story about this kind of thinking:- there was an

~~did not like him. so he looked through a dictionary and found that
~~carpenter means someone who works with wood, and by looking into
~~encyclopedias he found that the ancestors that family were wood workers.
~~congratulating himself for this discovery ;he began a campaign against
~~dr. carpenter telling everyone that he`s a fraudulent; claiming to be a
~~doctor while in reality he`s a wood worker. during this, his illness
~~grew even worse, he feared that he might be prosecuted for libel, also
~~there was a possibility that sick people might avoid visiting doctor
~~carpeneter who`s their regular doctor which may affect their case to
~~become worse . but fortunately most people realized that albert is an
~~idiot. in case someone does get the relevance of this story:- muslims
~~believe in allah as defined in the quran not as found in archeology. who
~~is the creator and the maintainer of the whole universe. 12- وصف الله
~~(تعالى عما يصفون) في الإنجيل 12- a biblical picture of god a biblical
~~picture of god PageV01P0460
# a biblical picture of god a muslim believes that god is unlike
~~anything we can imagine. no one can look at him and live. he never
~~tires. he is all-knowing, all-seeing, all-powerful, perfect. all he
~~needs do is decree a matter and it will be. yet the language of the
~~current bible never fails to picture even god himself in undignified
~~terms: god goes for a stroll: genesis 3:8 "and they heard the voice of
~~the lord god walking in the garden in the cool of the day: and adam and
~~his wife hid themselves from the presence of the lord god amongst the
~~trees of the garden." god can not find adam (not all-knowing): genesis
~~3:9-10 "and the lord god called unto adam, and said unto him, where are
~~you? and he said, i heard your voice in the garden, and i was afraid,
~~because i was naked; and i hid myself."(from god?) god does not know if
~~adam ate from the tree or not (not all-knowing): genesis 3:11 "and he
~~(god) said, who told thee that thou wast naked? hast thou eaten of the
~~tree, whereof i commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?" before
~~looking for hidden meanings for the above verses, we should consider the
~~following: 1) read section 2.3. 2) if you were to give your child total,
~~unconstrained freedom to do whatever he wants in your house, you only
~~ask him "don’t play with my stereo." if he then goes ahead anyway and
~~proceeds to dismantle it into fifty different pieces. PageV01P0461
# if you know for a fact that he did it and you know exactly where he
~~has hidden himself (maybe you had a hidden camera somewhere), would you
~~walk all over the house calling out "where are you my son?," "come out,
~~come out wherever you are"?, or would you storm up to the place where he
~~was hiding, pull him out by his ears, and punish him severely? 3) if you
~~did not know where he was hiding, but knew what he had done without a
~~doubt, would you, once you had found him, ask him: "why are you hiding?
~~did you break my stereo?" it is important to first attempt to think
~~logically before looking for abstract meanings. note: for the islamic
~~version of this incident please read chapter 15. god becomes tired and
~~needs to be *******ed: exodus 31:17 "it is a sign between me and the
~~children of israel for ever: for in six days the lord made heaven and
~~earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was *******ed." notice that
~~the verse does not claim that god almighty "abstained from work," but
~~rather that he "rested." this implies that it is possible for god
~~almighty to experience fatigue and that he is not all-mighty and all-
~~powerful since he sometimes needs to be "*******ed." god is not
~~cognizant and/or is not eternally aware (not all knowing, all seeing,
~~attentive and aware): psalms 44:23 "awake, why sleepest thou, o lord?
~~arise, cast us not off for ever." when god finally becomes cognizant
~~attentive and aware, he acts like a drunkard: psalms 78:65 "then the
~~lord awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that shouteth by
~~reason of wine. PageV01P0462
# " the above verses are responded to by the almighty in the noble
~~qur’an as follows: "and verily we (god) did create the heavens and the
~~earth in six days and no fatigue touched us." the noble qur’an,
~~qaf(50):38 "allah! there is no god but he, the living, the sustainer and
~~protector. neither slumber nor sleep overtake him. his are all things in
~~the heavens and the earth. who can intercede in his presence except as
~~he permits? he knows what is before and behind them. nor do they
~~encompass aught of his knowledge except as he wills. his throne does
~~extend over the heavens and the earth and he feels no fatigue in
~~preserving them. for he is the most high, the supreme." the noble
~~qur’an, al-baqarah(2):255 jacob wrestles with god. god can not win
~~against jacob. jacob sees god face to face: "and jacob was left alone;
~~and there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day. and
~~when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of
~~his thigh; and the hollow of jacob's thigh was out of joint, as he
~~wrestled with him. and he said, let me go, for the day breaketh. and he
~~said, i will not let thee go, except thou bless me. and he said unto
~~him, what is thy name? and he said, jacob. and he said, thy name shall
~~be called no more jacob, but israel: for as a prince hast thou power
~~with god and with men, and hast prevailed. and jacob asked him, and
~~said, tell me, i pray thee, thy name. and he said, wherefore is it that
~~thou dost ask after my name? and he blessed him there. PageV01P0463
# and jacob called the name of the place peniel: for i have seen god
~~face to face, and my life is preserved." genesis 32:24-30 many people
~~claim the jacob wrestled with an angel. does this sound like he wrestled
~~with an angel? did jacob (pbuh) say "i have seen the angel of god"? did
~~he say "i have seen the light of god" or some other statement that might
~~have had an abstract meaning? no! he said "i have seen god" and just so
~~that there would be no doubt in anyone's mind he added the words "face
~~to face." if jacob (pbuh) had wrestled with an angel, then why would he
~~need to say "my life is preserved"? do people who see angels die?
~~(numbers 22:31, 2 samuel 24:17, 1 chronicles 21:16, ...etc.). if jacob
~~had seen the face of an angel then why would he name the place "the face
~~of god"(peni-el), and not "the face of the angel"(peni-malak)? indeed,
~~this is how the great st. augustine and many others understood this
~~verse. this brings up another question. how do we reconcile this with
~~point 25 in the table of section 2.2 (regarding seeing god)? we are
~~beaten over the head four times with the fact that a human (jacob, peace
~~be upon him) managed to out-wrestle god almighty, but the translators
~~realizing the fallacy of this concoction continually try to reinterpret
~~this verse and make excuses for it. notice how we are beaten over the
~~head not once, but four times with the fact that this was god who was
~~beaten by jacob: 1) "i have seen god." 2) "face to face." 3) "and my
~~life is preserved." 4) they called the place "peniel" ("face of god").
~~PageV01P0464
# are we now to believe that god wrestled with jacob all night, he
~~resorted to hitting jacob (pbuh) below the belt, and in the end was
~~still bested by jacob ("i will not let thee go, except thou bless me")?
~~when someone has you in a headlock and tells you: "do as i tell you," is
~~he victorious or not? god forbid! high exalted is he! illustrious!
~~mighty! magnificent! all-powerful! neither moses nor jacob would ever
~~make such a claim. nor would the other prophets of god. the great and
~~noble prophets would never dare to claim that god had been reduced to a
~~punching bag to further their own egos. notice how we are encouraged to
~~believe that it is not sufficient to humbly prostrate oneself before
~~god, bowing down and beseeching him for his favors in earnest prayer and
~~in all submission. rather it is necessary to slap him silly and beat him
~~into the ground then force him to bless the victor. is this not
~~preposterous? does this not reek of tampering fingers? may god almighty
~~forgive me for even repeating these words. god regrets his actions, god
~~can not see the future, god can not change the past: genesis 6:6 "and it
~~repented the lord that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him
~~at his heart." it is not possible to regret doing something unless the
~~result of this action was something bad that had not been foreseen and
~~can not be changed. in webster's new dictionary (1990), the word
~~"repent" is defined as follows: to regret, sorrow for, to wish to have
~~been otherwise what one has done or left undone. PageV01P0465
# thus, god is claimed to be: 1) unable to see the future: if i know for
~~a certainty that performing "action" will result in "result," then when
~~"result" comes about i will not regret it unless i was forced in the
~~first place to perform "action." there is a difference between
~~"disliking" something and "regretting" something. 2) unable to change
~~the past if he wanted to: as per the above webster's definition, to
~~repent is to "wish to have been otherwise what one has done or left
~~undone." but if god is capable of doing all things, as a muslim
~~believes, then he does not need to "wish." he simply decrees it and it
~~is. also notice that god is not merely claimed to have regretted this
~~action, but to have "grieved at his heart." webster's defines grief as:
~~deep sorrow caused by loss, distress. so according to this passage, god
~~felt the deepest sorrow from the bottom of his heart. if one of us felt
~~this kind of torment and was given the means to change matters, would we
~~hesitate? god is not this helpless! for the islamic perspective on god
~~almighty, read the following: god almighty: al-ikhlas(112):1-4,
~~kaaf(50):38, al-aaraf(7):143, al-shurah(24):11-12, al-anaam(6):3,

~~13- لماذا يقول الله تعالى "نحن" في القرآن الكريم عن نفسه؟ 13- "why does
~~it say "we" in quran when referring to god (allah)?" PageV01P0466
# "why does it say "we" in quran when referring to god (allah)?" this is
~~a good question and one that bible readers have also asked about. the
~~term "we" in the bible and in the quran is the royal "we" - as an
~~example when the king says, "we decree the following declaration, etc."
~~or, "we are not amused." it does not indicate plural; rather it displays
~~the highest position in the language. english, persian, hebrew, arabic
~~and many languages provide for the usage of "we" for the royal figure.
~~it is helpful to note the same dignity is given to the person being
~~spoken to in english. we say to someone, "you are my friend." yet the
~~person is only one person standing there. why did we say "are" instead
~~of "is"? the noun "you" is singular and should therefore be associated
~~with a singular verb for the state of being, yet we say, "are." the same
~~is true for the speaker when referring to himself or herself. we say, "i
~~am" and this is also in the royal plural, instead of saying, "i is."
~~14- لم مذكور في القرآن الكريم "هو" عن الله سبحانه وتعالى؟ 14- "why does
~~quran say "he" when referring to god (allah) if god is not having
~~gender?" PageV01P0467
# "why does quran say "he" when referring to god (allah) if god is not
~~having gender?" this is similar to the above answer. the word "he" is
~~used when referring to allah out of respect, dignity and high status. it
~~would be totally inappropriate to use the word "it" and would not convey
~~the proper understanding of allah being who allah is; alive,
~~compassionate, forgiving, patient, loving, etc. it is not correct to
~~associate the word "he" with gender, as this would be comparing allah to
~~the creation, something totally against the teaching of quran. 15-

~~look upon you." allâh said: "you cannot see me, but look upon the

~~informed him that the mountain ,with its strength & solidity ,doesn't
~~still when god appears (manifestation). PageV01P0470

~~bases 1. nonexistence creates nothing if we contemplate the creatures
~~which are born everyday whether humans,animals or plants and think of
~~what is happening in the universe where wind,rain, night or day and look
~~at what happening in every time of orderly movementsof the sun, moon,
~~stars or plants, the mind will surely admit that all thingsare not
~~created haphazardly, but by the creator, the existent (dignifiedbe he).
~~allah the almighty said: “were they created of nothing, or were they
~~themselves the creators? or did they create the heavens and the earth?
~~nay, they have no firm belief”. (at-tur: 35-36) 1. thinking of the
~~created elaborates on some characteristicsof the creator the components
~~of the created indicates the capability or the characteristics of the
~~maker. in other words, unless the maker has certain abilities or
~~characteristics,which can enable him to do things, the created object
~~will be void of anythingwhich is indicative of its maker. for example,
~~if you see a door, whichis perfectly made from wood, you will realize
~~that the maker has a wood,is able to systemically cut it, is able to
~~make this wood smooth, has pinswith which he can fasten the parts of the
~~door, and he has experience inmanufacturing doors. by the same token, if
~~we see a straight hole in thedoor (keyhole), this indicates that the
~~maker has the ability to accuratelydrill and make the keyhole for the
~~door. PageV01P0472
# therefore, thinking about the manufacturedthing will lead us to
~~realizing the skills of the manufacturer and thinkingin the creatures
~~will lead us to know the traits of the creator. allah thealmighty said:
~~“verily in the heavens and the earth, are signs for those who believe.
~~and in the creation of yourselves and the fact that animals are
~~scattered (through the earth), are signs for those of assured faith. and
~~in the alteration of night and day, and the fact that allah sends down
~~sustenance from the sky,and revives therewith the earth after its death,
~~and in the change of thewinds, are signs for those that are wise. such
~~are the signs of allah, whichwe rehearse to thee in truth: then in what
~~exposition will they believe afterallah and his signs”. (al-jathiya:
~~3-6) if we ponder and think about the creatures, the signs of allah will
~~leadus to some of allah’s attributes. allah the almighty said: “say:
~~behold all that is in the heavens and on earth ... ” (yunus: 101) and
~~allah the almighty also said: “do they see nothing in the kingdom of the
~~heavens and the earth andall that allah hath created? (do they not see)
~~that it may well be that theirterm is nigh drawing to an end? in what
~~message after this will they thenbelieve?”. (al-a’raf: 185) 1. the owner
~~of nothing gives nothing money cannot be asked from the one who has no
~~money and knowledge cannotbe sought from the ignorant, for the one who
~~is void of something cannotgive it to others. through thinking about the
~~creatures of allah, the signslead us to the attributes of the creator;
~~exalted and dignified be he. PageV01P0473
# andif we know the attributes, we will know the described. those who
~~claimthat nature created them, come into conflict with what the mind and
~~the truthhave admitted. that is because the universe bears witness that
~~its creatoris the all-wise, full of knowledge, well-aware, the one who
~~guides, the onewho has no partner. the stone-deaf and solid nature has
~~neither knowledge,nor wisdom, nor life, nor mercy, nor will; how they
~~did then think in thatway and the one who is void of something cannot
~~give it to others. what is nature nature consists of various kinds of
~~creatures along with their characteristics. the idolaters worshipped
~~some parts of the nature such as sun, moon, stars,fire, stones, and the
~~humans. the neo-idolaters (naturalists) imagine thatthe previous idols
~~(nature) has created them, although nature has no mindand they have, it
~~has no knowledge and they have, has no experience and theyhave, and has
~~no will and they have. didn’t they know that the one who isvoid of
~~something cannot give it to others. allah the almighty said: “o men!
~~here is a parable set forth! listen to it! thoseon whom, besides allah,
~~ye call, cannot create (even) a fly, if they allmet together for the
~~purpose and if the fly should snatch away anything fromthem, they would
~~have no power to realize it from the fly. feeble are thosewho petition

~~atheist philosopher. the decisive factor in this radical change of view
~~is the clear and definitive evidence revealed by science on the subject
~~of creation. flew realised, in the face of the information-based
~~complexity of life, that the true origin of life is intelligent design
~~and that the atheism he had espoused for 66 years was a discredited
~~philosophy. flew announced the scientific reasons underlying this change
~~in belief in these terms: "biologists' investigation of dna has shown,
~~by the almost unbelievable complexity of the arrangements which are
~~needed to produce [life], that intelligence must have been involved."
~~(1) "it has become inordinately difficult even to begin to think about
~~constructing a naturalistic theory of the evolution of that first
~~reproducing organism." (2) "i have been persuaded that it is simply out
~~of the question that the first living matter evolved out of dead matter
~~and then developed into an extraordinarily complicated creature." (3)
~~the dna research which flew cites as a fundamental reason for his change
~~of opinion has indeed revealed striking facts about creation.
~~PageV01P0475
# the helix shape of the dna molecule, its possession of the genetic
~~code, the nucleotide strings that refute blind chance, the storage of
~~encyclopaedic quantities of information and many other striking findings
~~have revealed that the structure and functions of this molecule were
~~arranged for life with a special design. comments by scientists
~~concerned with dna research bear witness to this fact. francis crick,
~~for instance, one of the scientists who revealed the helix shape of dna
~~admitted in the face of the findings regarding dna that the origin of
~~life indicated a miracle: an honest man, armed with all the knowledge
~~available to us now, could only state that in some sense, the origin of
~~life appears at the moment to be almost a miracle, so many are the
~~conditions which would have had to have been satisfied to get it going.
~~(4) based on his calculations, led adleman of the university of southern
~~california in los angeles has stated that one gram of dna can store as
~~much information as a trillion compact discs. (5) gene myers, a
~~scientist employed on the human genome project, has said the following
~~in the face of the miraculous arrangements he witnessed: "what really
~~astounds me is the architecture of life ... the system is extremely
~~complex. it's like it was designed ... there's a huge intelligence
~~there." (6) the most striking fact about dna is that the existence of
~~the coded genetic information can definitely not be explained in terms
~~of matter and energy or natural laws. dr. PageV01P0476
# werner gitt, a professor at the german federal institute of physics
~~and technology, has said this on the subject: a code system is always
~~the result of a mental process ... it should be emphasized that matter
~~as such is unable to generate any code. all experiences indicate that a
~~thinking being voluntarily exercising his own free will, cognition, and
~~creativity, is required ... there is no known natural law through which
~~matter can give rise to information, neither is any physical process or
~~material phenomenon known that can do this. (7) creationist scientists
~~and philosophers played a major role in flew's acceptance of intelligent
~~design, backed up by all these findings. in recent times flew
~~participated in debates with scientists and philosophers who were
~~proponents of creation, and exchanged ideas with them. the final turning
~~point in that process was a discussion organised by the institute for
~~****scientific research in texas in may, 2003. flew participated
~~together with author roy abraham varghese, israeli physicist and
~~molecular biologist gerald schroeder, and roman catholic philosopher
~~john haldane. flew was impressed by the weight of the scientific
~~evidence in favour of creation and by the convincing nature of his
~~opponents' arguments, and abandoned atheism as an idea in the period
~~following that discussion. in a letter he wrote for the august-
~~september, 2003, edition of the british magazine philosophy now, he
~~recommended schroeder's book "the hidden face of god: science reveals
~~the ultimate truth" and varghese's book "the wonderful world.
~~PageV01P0477
# "(8) during an interview with the professor of philosophy and theology
~~gary r. habermas, who also played a major role in his change of mind
~~(9), and also on the video "has science discovered god?," he openly
~~stated that he believed in intelligent design. the "intelligence
~~pervading the universe" and the collapse of atheism in the face of all
~~the scientific developments outlined above, the acceptance of
~~intelligent design by antony flew, famous for defending atheism for many
~~years, reflects a final scene in the process of collapse being undergone
~~by atheism. modern science has revealed the existence of an
~~"intelligence pervading the universe," thus leaving atheism out of the
~~equation. in his book "the hidden face of god," gerald schroeder, one of
~~the creationist scientists who influenced flew, writes: "a single
~~consciousness, a universal wisdom, pervades the universe. the
~~discoveries of science, those that search the quantum nature of
~~subatomic matter, have moved us to the brink of a startling realization:
~~all existence is the expression of this wisdom. in the laboratories we
~~experience it as information that first physically articulated as energy
~~and then condensed into the form of matter. every particle, every being,
~~from atom to human, appears to represent a level of information, of
~~wisdom." (10) scientific research into both the functioning of the cell
~~and the subatomic particles of matter has revealed this fact in an
~~indisputable manner: life and the universe were brought into being from
~~nothing by the will of an entity possessed of a superior mind and
~~wisdom. PageV01P0478
# there is no doubt that the possessor of that knowledge and mind that
~~pervade the universe at all levels is almighty allah. allah reveals this
~~truth in the qur'an: both east and west belong to allah, so wherever you

# conditions of laa ilaaha illa-allaah question : can you please explain
~~the conditions of laa ilaaha ill-allaah (knowledge, certainty, etc), and
~~tell us the rulings on one who does not attain them and one who is
~~ignorant of the meaning of laa ilaaha ill-allaah? answer : praise be to
~~allaah. the conditions of laa ilaaha ill-allaah. shaykh haafiz al-hukmi
~~said in his poem sullam al-wusool : “knowledge, certainty, submission
~~and following. so listen to what i say. truthfulness, sincerity and
~~love. may allaah help you to do that which he loves.” the first
~~condition is knowledge, in the sense of negating what is negated in the
~~shahaadah and affirming what is affirmed therein – as opposed to being
~~ignorant of that. allaah says (interpretation of the meanings): “so know
~~(o muhammad) that laa ilaaha ill-allaah (none has the right to be
~~worshipped but allaah) ... ” [muhammad 47:19] “except for those who bear
~~witness to the truth knowingly” – i.e., that there is no god except
~~allaah (laa ilaaha ill-allaah) – “and they know” – in their hearts the
~~meaning of the words that they utter with their lips. [al-zukhruf 43:86]
~~it is narrated in al-saheeh from ‘uthmaan (may allaah be pleased with
~~him) that the messenger of allaah (peace and blessings of allaah be upon
~~him) said: “whoever dies knowing that there is no god except allaah will
~~enter paradise.” the second condition is certainty, in the sense that
~~the one who says these words is absolutely certain of their meaning.
~~faith is not sufficient unless it is based on certain knowledge with no
~~element of speculation, let alone doubt. PageV01P0480
# allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “only those are the
~~believers who have believed in allaah and his messenger, and afterward
~~doubt not but strive with their wealth and their lives for the cause of
~~allaah. those! they are the truthful”[al-hujuraat 49:15] the sincerity
~~of their faith in allaah and his messenger is conditional upon there
~~being no element of doubt therein, as for the doubter, he is one of the
~~hypocrites. in al-saheeh it is narrated that abu hurayrah said: “the
~~messenger of allaah (peace and blessings of allaah be upon him) said:
~~‘bear witness that there is no god except allaah and that i am the
~~messenger of allaah, for no person meets allaah with these two, not
~~doubting in them, but he will enter paradise.’” according to another
~~report: “no person meets allaah with these two, not doubting in them,
~~and is denied paradise.” and it was also narrated from abu hurayrah in a
~~lengthy hadeeth that the prophet (peace and blessings of allaah be upon
~~him) sent him and said, “whoever you meet behind this wall who bears
~~witness that there is no god except allaah, believing in it with
~~certainty in his heart, then give him the glad tidings of paradise.”
~~thus we see that a person’s entering paradise for saying these words is
~~conditional upon his believing in them with certainty in his heart, with
~~no element of doubt. if this condition is not met the target is not met.
~~the third condition is acceptance and submission to what these words
~~imply, both in one's heart as well as verbally. PageV01P0481
# allaah has told us the stories of those who came before, who were
~~saved by their acceptance of these words from the punishment of those
~~who had rejected them. allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “(it
~~will be said to the angels): ‘assemble those who did wrong, together
~~with their companions (from the devils) and what they used to worship,
~~instead of allaah, and lead them on to the way of flaming fire (hell);
~~but stop them, verily, they are to be questioned. what is the matter
~~with you? why do you not help one another (as you used to do in the
~~world)?’ nay, but that day they shall surrender. and they will turn to
~~one another and question one another. they will say: ‘it was you who
~~used to come to us from the right side (i.e., from the right side of one
~~of us and beautify for us every evil, enjoin on us polytheism, and stop
~~us from the truth, i.e. islamic monotheism and from every good deed).’
~~they will reply: ‘nay, you yourselves were not believers. and we had no
~~authority over you. nay! but you were taaghoon (transgressing) people
~~(polytheists, and disbelievers). so now the word of our lord has been
~~justified against us, that we shall certainly (have to) taste (the
~~torment). so we led you astray because we were ourselves astray.’ then
~~verily, that day, they will (all) share in the torment. certainly, that
~~is how we deal with al mujrimoon (polytheists, sinners, disbelievers,
~~criminals, the disobedient to allaah). truly, when it was said to them:
~~laa ilaaha ill-allaah (none has the right “to be worshipped but
~~allaah),” they puffed themselves up with pride (i.e. PageV01P0482
# denied it). and (they) said: ‘are we going to abandon our aalihah
~~(gods) for the sake of a mad poet?’”[al-saffaat 37:22-36] so allaah has
~~made the reason and cause of their punishment their arrogant refusal to
~~say laa ilaah ill-allaah, and their disbelief in the one who brought
~~this message, so that they did not negate what this word negates and
~~they did not affirm what it affirms, rather they said, arrogantly
~~denouncing: “ ‘has he made the aalihah (gods) (all) into one ilaah (god
~~— allaah). verily, this is a curious thing!’ and the leaders among them
~~went about (saying): ‘go on, and remain constant to your aalihah (gods)!
~~verily, this is a thing designed (against you)!’”[saad 38:5] so allaah
~~showed them to be liars and threw their words back at them through the
~~words of his messenger (peace and blessings of allaah be upon him). he
~~said (interpretation of the meaning): “nay! he (muhammad) has come with
~~the truth (i.e. allaah’s religion — islamic monotheism and this qur’aan)
~~and he confirms the messengers (before him who brought allaah’s religion
~~— islamic monotheism)”[al-saffaat 37:37] then he said concerning those
~~who accept it (interpretation of the meaning): “save the chosen slaves
~~of allaah (i.e. the true believers of islamic monotheism). PageV01P0483
# for them there will be a known provision (in paradise), fruits; and
~~they shall be honoured, in the gardens of delight (paradise)”[al-saffaat
~~37:40-43] in al-saheeh it is narrated from abu moosa (may allaah be
~~pleased with him) that the prophet (peace and blessings of allaah be
~~upon him) said: “the guidance and knowledge with which allaah has sent
~~me is like abundant rain which falls on the land. some of the land
~~absorbs the water and brings forth much grass and vegetation. and some
~~of (the rain) falls on another part of the land which is like a smooth
~~plain and does not hold the water, so no vegetation grows. that is the
~~likeness of the one who understands the religion of allaah and benefits
~~from that with which allaah has sent me, so he learns and acts, and the
~~likeness of the one who pays no heed and does not accept the guidance of
~~allaah with which i have been sent. the fourth condition is following
~~that which is indicated, as opposed to not following it. allaah says
~~(interpretation of the meaning): “and whosoever submits his face
~~(himself) to allaah, while he is a muhsin (good doer, i.e. performs good
~~deeds totally for allaah’s sake), then he has grasped the most
~~trustworthy handhold” – i.e., laa ilaaha ill-allaah – “and to allaah
~~return all matters for decision”[luqmaan 31:22] what is meant by
~~“submitting one’s face” is following, when one is also a doer of good
~~and a believer in tawheed. whoever does not submit his face to allaah
~~and is not a doer of good has not grasped the most trustworthy handhold.
~~PageV01P0484
# this is what is meant by the following aayah (interpretation of the
~~meaning): “and whoever disbelieves, let not his disbelief grieve you (o
~~muhammad). to us is their return, and we shall inform them what they
~~have done ... ”[luqmaan 31:23] according to a saheeh hadeeth, the
~~messenger of allaah (peace and blessings of allaah be upon him) said:
~~“none of you truly believes until his desire is in accordance with that
~~which i have brought.” this is the ultimate meaning of following. the
~~fifth condition is truthfulness, as opposed to lying. this means that
~~one says it (laa ilaaha ill-allaah) sincerely from the heart, with
~~harmony between what is in the heart and what is said on the lips.
~~allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “do people think that they
~~will be left alone because they say: ‘we believe,’ and will not be
~~tested. and we indeed tested those who were before them. and allaah will
~~certainly make (it) known (the truth of) those who are true, and will
~~certainly make (it) known (the falsehood of) those who are liars,
~~(although allaah knows all that before putting them to
~~test)”[al-‘ankaboot 29:2-3] and he said concerning the hypocrites who
~~spoke these words falsely (interpretation of the meaning): “and of
~~mankind, there are some (hypocrites) who say: ‘we believe in allaah and
~~the last day,’ while in fact they believe not. they (think to) deceive
~~allaah and those who believe, while they only deceive themselves, and
~~perceive (it) not! in their hearts is a disease (of doubt and hypocrisy)
~~and allaah has increased their disease. PageV01P0485
# a painful torment is theirs because they used to tell lies” [al-
~~baqarah 2:8-10] in al-saheehayn it is narrated from mu’aadh ibn jabal
~~(may allaah be pleased with him) that the prophet (peace and blessings
~~of allaah be upon him) said, “there is no one who bears witness that
~~there is no god except allaah and that muhammad is his slave and
~~messenger, sincerely from the heart, but allaah will make him forbidden
~~for the fire.” the sixth condition is sincerity, which means that
~~actions are free from any element of shirk. allaah says (interpretation
~~of the meaning): “surely, the religion (i.e. the worship and the
~~obedience) is for allaah only [al-zumar 39:3] “say (o muhammad): ‘allaah
~~alone i worship by doing religious deeds sincerely for his sake only
~~’”[al-zumar 39:14] in al-saheeh it is narrated from abu hurayrah that
~~the prophet (peace and blessings of allaah be upon him) said: “the most
~~deserving of my intercession are those who say laa ilaaha ill-allaah
~~sincerely from the heart or from the soul.” the seventh condition is
~~love for this word and for what it implies and indicates, and love for
~~the people who act upon it and adhere to its conditions and hate whoever
~~or whatever goes against it. allaah says (interpretation of the
~~meaning): “and of mankind are some who take (for worship) others besides
~~allaah as rivals (to allaah). PageV01P0486
# they love them as they love allaah”[al-baqarah 2:165] allaah tells us
~~that those who believe love allaah more, because they do not associate
~~anything with him in that love, as is done by those among the mushrikeen
~~who claim to love him but who also take others as rivals to him whom
~~they love as they love him. in al-saheehayn it is narrated from anas
~~that the messenger of allaah (peace and blessings of allaah be upon him)
~~said: “no one of you truly believes until i am more beloved to him that
~~his son, his father and all of mankind.” source http://63.175.194.25/

# the meaning of belief in allaah question : i have read and heard a
~~great deal about the virtues of attaining true belief in allaah, and i
~~would like you to explain to me in detail the meaning of belief in
~~allaah in a way that will help me to attain true faith and to keep away
~~from everything that goes against the teachings of our prophet muhammad
~~(peace and blessings of allaah be upon him) and the way of his
~~companions. answer : praise be to allaah. faith in allaah means
~~believing firmly in his existence, lordship and divinity, and in his
~~names and attributes. faith in allaah implies four things, whoever
~~believes in them is a true believer. 1 – belief in the existence of
~~allaah. the existence of allaah is something indicated by reason and by
~~man's innate nature, let alone the large amount of shar’i evidence to
~~that effect. (i) the evidence of man’s innate nature that allaah exists:
~~every man has been created with an innate belief in his creator without
~~having to first think about it or be taught, and no one deviates from
~~this innate nature except the one who has been exposed to misguiding
~~influences. hence the prophet (peace and blessings of allaah be upon
~~him) said: “there is no child who is not born in a state of fitrah (the
~~natural inclination of man), but his parents make him a jew, a christian
~~or a magian.” narrated by al-bukhaari, 1358; muslim, 2658. PageV01P0490
# (ii) the evidence of reason that allaah exists: all these created
~~things, past, present and future, must have a creator who brought them
~~into existence, because it is not possible for them to have created
~~themselves or to have come into existence by accident. it is impossible
~~for them to have come into existence by themselves because a thing
~~cannot create itself: before it existed it was non-existent, so how
~~could it be a creator?! and it is impossible for them to have come into
~~existence by accident, because everything that happens must have a
~~cause. moreover, this creation is done in a wondrous and precise manner,
~~and every created being is in harmony with the rest of creation, and
~~there is a strong connection between cause and effect. all of this makes
~~it impossible that this universe could have come into being
~~accidentally, because what happens accidentally does not happen in a
~~precise and perfect manner, so how could it remain so precisely
~~balanced? if it is not possible for these things to have created
~~themselves or to have come into existence by accident, then there must
~~be one who brought them into existence, namely allaah the lord of the
~~worlds. allaah has mentioned this rational evidence and definitive proof
~~in soorat al-toor, where he says (interpretation of the meaning): “were
~~they created by nothing? or were they themselves the creators?” [al-toor
~~52:35] they were not created without a creator, and they did not create
~~themselves, so their creator must be allaah, may he be blessed and
~~exalted. PageV01P0491
# hence when jubayr ibn mut’im heard the messenger of allaah (s)
~~reciting soorat al-toor, and he reached these verses (interpretation of
~~the meaning): “were they created by nothing? or were they themselves the
~~creators? or did they create the heavens and the earth? nay, but they
~~have no firm belief. or are with them the treasures of your lord? or are
~~they the tyrants with the authority to do as they like?” [al-toor
~~52:35-37] jabeer was a mushrik at that time, and said: “my heart almost
~~soared, and that was the first moment that faith entered my heart.”
~~narrated by al-bukhaari in several places. we will give you an example
~~that will help to explain that: if a person were to tell you of a
~~beautiful palace, surrounded by gardens among which rivers flowed,
~~filled with furniture and couches, decorated with all kinds of luxuries
~~and adornments, and told you that this palace and all that it contains
~~created itself, or came into existence like that by accident without
~~anyone building it, you would hasten to deny that and regard it as a
~~lie, and you would regard this as foolish speech. PageV01P0492
# so after that can it be possible that this wondrous, vast and well
~~balanced universe with its earth, heavens and stars, could have created
~~itself or come into being by accident with no creator?! this rational
~~evidence was understood by a bedouin who lived in the desert and who
~~expressed it most eloquently, when he was asked, “how do you know your
~~lord?” he said: “if you see the camel dung you know that a camel has
~~passed this way, and if you see a footstep you know that a person has
~~passed this way, so the heaven with its starts and the earth with its
~~mountain passes and the oceans with their high waves all point to the
~~existence of the all-hearing, all-seeing.” 2 – belief in the lordship of
~~allaah. i.e., belief that he alone is the lord, with no partner or
~~helper. the lord (rabb) is the one who has the power of creation,
~~dominion and control. there is no creator except allaah, no sovereign
~~except allaah, no controller of affairs except allaah. allaah says
~~(interpretation of the meaning): “surely, his is the creation and
~~commandment” [al-a’raaf 7:54] “say (o muhammad): ‘who provides for you
~~from the sky and the earth? or who owns hearing and sight? and who
~~brings out the living from the dead and brings out the dead from the
~~living? and who disposes the affairs?’ they will say: ‘allaah.
~~PageV01P0493
# ’ say: ‘will you not then be afraid of allaah’s punishment (for
~~setting up rivals in worship with allaah)?’” [yoonus 10:31] “he manages
~~and regulates (every) affair from the heavens to the earth; then it
~~(affair) will go up to him” [al-sajdah 32:5] “such is allaah, your lord;
~~his is the kingdom. and those, whom you invoke or call upon instead of
~~him, own not even a qitmeer (the thin membrane over the date stone)”
~~[faatir 35:13] think about what allaah says in soorat al-faatihah
~~(interpretation of the meaning): “the only owner (and the only ruling
~~judge) of the day of recompense (i.e. the day of resurrection) [maaliki
~~yaawm il-deen]” [al-faatihah 1:4] and there is an alternative reading,
~~maliki yawm il-deen. if we combine the two readings we will see a
~~wondrous meaning, for the malik (king) has more power and authority than
~~the maalik (owner), but a king may sometimes be a king in name only,
~~with no control over affairs, in which case he is a king but not an
~~owner. but as allaah is both malik and maalik, then this is confirmation
~~both of his sovereignty and his control over all affairs. 3 – belief in
~~his divinity i.e., that he is the one true god, with no partner or
~~associate. al-ilaah (god) means the one who is loved, i.e., the one who
~~is worshipped out of love and veneration. this is what is meant by laa
~~ilaaha ill-allaah (there is no god but allaah), i.e., there is none who
~~is rightfully worshipped except allaah. PageV01P0494
# allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “and your ilaah (god) is
~~one ilaah (god — allaah), laa ilaaha illa huwa (there is none who has
~~the right to be worshipped but he), the most gracious, the most
~~merciful” [al-baqarah 2:163] “allaah bears witness that laa ilaaha illa
~~huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but he), and the angels, and
~~those having knowledge (also give this witness); (he always) maintains
~~his creation in justice. laa ilaaha illa huwa (none has the right to be
~~worshipped but he), the all mighty, the all-wise” [aal ‘imraan 3:18]
~~everything that is taken as a god alongside allaah and worshipped
~~instead of him, its divinity is false. allaah says (interpretation of
~~the meaning): “that is because allaah he is the truth (the only true god
~~of all that exists, who has no partners or rivals with him), and what
~~they (the polytheists) invoke besides him, it is baatil (falsehood). and
~~verily, allaah he is the most high, the most great” [al-hajj 22:62]
~~calling them gods does not give them the rights of divinity.

# allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “they are but names which
~~you have named you and your fathers for which allaah has sent down no
~~authority” [al-najm 53:23] allaah tells us that yoosuf (peace be upon
~~him) said to the prison guard (interpretation of the meaning): “are many
~~different lords (gods) better or allaah, the one, the irresistible? you
~~do not worship besides him but only names which you have named (forged)
~~— you and your fathers — for which allaah has sent down no authority”
~~[yoosuf 12:39-40] no one deserves to be worshipped or singled out for
~~worship except allaah, and no one has any share in this right with him,
~~no angel who is close to him nor any prophet who was sent. hence the
~~call of all the messengers, from the first to the last of them, was the
~~call to say laa ilaaha ill-allaah. allaah says (interpretation of the
~~meaning): “and we did not send any messenger before you (o muhammad) but
~~we revealed to him (saying): laa ilaaha illa ana [none has the right to
~~be worshipped but i (allaah)], so worship me (alone and none else)” [al-
~~anbiya’ 21:35] “and verily, we have sent among every ummah (community,
~~nation) a messenger (proclaiming): “worship allaah (alone), and avoid
~~(or keep away from) taaghoot (all false deities, i.e. do not worship
~~taaghoot besides allaah)” [al-nahl 16:36] but the mushrikeen rejected
~~that and took other gods instead of allaah, which they worshipped
~~alongside allaah, seeking their support and help. 4 – belief in his
~~names and attributes. i.e. PageV01P0496
# , affirming the names and attributes which allaah has affirmed for
~~himself in his book and in the sunnah of his messenger (peace and
~~blessings of allaah be upon him) in a manner that befits him, without
~~distorting or denying the meanings, or asking how, or likening him to
~~his creation. allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “and (all)
~~the most beautiful names belong to allaah, so call on him by them, and
~~leave the company of those who belie or deny (or utter impious speech
~~against) his names. they will be requited for what they used to do”
~~[al-a’raaf 7:180] this verse indicates that the most beautiful names
~~belong to allaah. and allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “his
~~is the highest de******ion (i.e. none has the right to be worshipped but
~~he, and there is nothing comparable unto him) in the heavens and in the
~~earth. and he is the all mighty, the all wise” [al-room 30:27] this
~~verse indicates that the attributes of perfection belong to allaah,
~~because “the highest de******ion” is the attribute of perfection. these
~~two verses prove that the most beautiful names and the most sublime
~~attributes belong to allaah in general terms. with regard to the details
~~of that, there is a great deal of information in the qur’aan and sunnah.
~~this field of knowledge, i.e., the names and attributes of allaah, is
~~one of the fields in which there has been a great deal of dispute and
~~division among the ummah, and the ummah has split into various factions
~~regarding the names and attributes of allaah. PageV01P0497
# our attitude towards these differences is that enjoined by allaah when
~~he said (interpretation of the meaning): “(and) if you differ in
~~anything amongst yourselves, refer it to allaah and his messenger, if
~~you believe in allaah and in the last day” [al-nisa’ 4:59] we refer this
~~dispute to the book of allaah and the sunnah of his messenger (peace and
~~blessings of allaah be upon him), seeking guidance therein from the way
~~in which the righteous salaf, the sahaabah and taabi’een, understood
~~these verses and ahaadeeth, for they are the most knowledgeable of this
~~ummah as to what allaah and his messenger meant. ‘abd-allaah ibn mas’ood
~~spoke the truth when he described the companions of the prophet (peace
~~and blessings of allaah be upon him) by saying: “whoever wants to follow
~~a path, let him follow the path of one who has died, for there is no
~~guarantee that the one who is still alive will not be tempted. those are
~~the companions of muhammad (peace and blessings of allaah be upon him),
~~the most pure in heart of this ummah and the most deep in knowledge, the
~~least sophisticated and complicated, people whom allaah chose to
~~establish his religion and accompany his prophet. so acknowledge their
~~rights and adhere to their guidance, for they are following true
~~guidance. PageV01P0498
# ” everyone who deviates from the path of the salaf in this matter is
~~erring and going astray, and is following a path other than that of the
~~believers, so he deserves the warning issued in the verse where allaah
~~says (interpretation of the meaning): “and whoever contradicts and
~~opposes the messenger (muhammad) after the right path has been shown
~~clearly to him, and follows other than the believers’ way, we shall keep
~~him in the path he has chosen, and burn him in hell — what an evil
~~destination!” [al-nisa’ 4:115] allaah has stipulated that in order to be
~~correctly guided, we must believe what the companions of the prophet
~~(peace and blessings of allaah be upon him) believed, as he says
~~(interpretation of the meaning): “so if they believe in the like of that
~~which you believe then they are rightly guided” [al-baqarah 2:137]
~~everyone who deviates and wanders far from the path of the salaf is
~~lacking in guidance to the extent that he strays from the path of the
~~salaf. based on this, then what we must do in this case is to affirm
~~what allaah has affirmed for himself or what his messenger (peace and
~~blessings of allaah be upon him) has affirmed of the divine names and
~~attributes; we should take the ****s of the qur’aan and sunnah at face
~~value, and believe in them as the companions of the prophet (peace and
~~blessings of allaah be upon him) did, as they are the best and most
~~knowledgeable of this ummah (may allaah be pleased with them).
~~PageV01P0499
# but it should be noted that there are four things to be avoided,
~~whoever falls into one of them has not attained true belief in the names
~~and attributes of allaah as he is obliged to do. belief in the names and
~~attributes of allaah is not correct unless one avoids these four things,
~~which are: tahreef (distortion), ta’teel (denial), tamtheel (likening
~~allaah to his creation) and takyeef (asking or discussing how). hence we
~~say that what is meant by belief in the names and attributes of allaah
~~is “affirming the names and attributes which allaah has affirmed for
~~himself in his book and in the sunnah of his messenger (peace and
~~blessings of allaah be upon him) in a manner that befits him, without
~~distorting or denying the meanings, or asking how, or likening him to
~~his creation.” there follows a brief explanation of these four things
~~that are to be avoided: (i) tahreef (distorting) what is meant is
~~changing the meaning of the ****s of the qur’aan and sunnah from their
~~true meaning, which means affirming that the most beautiful names and
~~sublime attributes belong to allaah, to another meaning which was not
~~intended by allaah or his messenger (peace and blessings of allaah be
~~upon him). for example: they distort the meaning of the hand of allaah
~~which is mentioned in many ****s and say that it refers to his blessing
~~or power. (ii) ta’teel (denying) what is meant is denying the beautiful
~~names and sublime attributes and saying that allaah does not possess
~~them or some of them. PageV01P0500
# everyone who denies one of the names or attributes of allaah that are
~~proven in the qur’aan or sunnah does not truly believe in the names and
~~attributes of allaah. (iii) tamtheel (likening allaah to his creation)
~~this means likening the attribute of allaah to the attribute of a human
~~being, such as saying that allaah’s hand is like a man’s hand, or that
~~allaah hears as a man hears, or that allaah rose over the throne like a
~~man sitting on a chair ... and so on. undoubtedly likening the
~~attributes of allaah to the attributes of his creation is wrong and
~~false. allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “there is nothing
~~like him, and he is the all hearer, the all seer” [al-shoora 42:11] (iv)
~~takyeef (discussing how) this means discussing how the attributes of
~~allaah are, whereby a person tries to imagine or put into words how the
~~attributes of allaah are. this is definitely invalid, and man cannot
~~know this. allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “but they will
~~never compass anything of his knowledge” [ta-ha 20:110] whoever attains
~~these four things believes truly in allaah. we ask allaah to make us
~~steadfast in faith and cause us to die therein. and allaah knows best.

~~do muslim women have to cover their heads . PageV02P0001
# for many women it is the truest test of being a muslim. the answer to
~~the question is very simple - muslim women observe hijab (covering the
~~head and the body) because allah has told them to do so. "o prophet,
~~tell your wives and daughters and the believing women to draw their
~~outer garments around them (when they go out or are among men). that is
~~better in order that they may be known (to be muslims) and not
~~annoyed..." (qur'an 33:59) other secondary reasons include the
~~requirement for modesty in both men and women. both will then be
~~evaluated for intelligence and skills instead of looks and sexuality. a
~~muslim school girl is quoted as saying, "we want to stop men from
~~treating us like sex objects, as they have always done. we want them to
~~ignore our appearance and to be attentive to our personalities and mind.
~~we want them to take us seriously and treat us as equals and not just
~~chase us around for our bodies and physical looks." a muslim woman who
~~covers her head is making a statement about her identity. anyone who
~~sees her will know that she is a muslim and has a good moral character.
~~many muslim women who cover are filled with dignity and self esteem;
~~they are pleased to be identified as a muslim woman. as a chaste,
~~modest, pure woman, she does not want her sexuality to enter into
~~interactions with men in the smallest degree. a woman who covers herself
~~is concealing her sexuality but allowing her femininity to be brought
~~out. often forgotten is the fact that modern western dress is a new
~~invention. PageV02P0002
# looking at the clothing of women as recently as seventy years ago, we
~~see clothing similar to hijab. these active and hard-working women of
~~the west were not inhibited by their clothing which consisted of long,
~~full dresses and various types of head covering. muslim women who wear
~~hijab do not find it impractical or interfering with their activities in
~~all levels and walks of life. hijab is not merely a covering dress but
~~more importantly, it is behavior, manners, speech and appearance in
~~public. dress is only one facet of the total being. the basic
~~requirement of the muslim woman's dress apply to the muslim man's
~~clothing with the difference being mainly in degree. modesty requires
~~that the area between the navel and the knee be covered in front of all
~~people except the wife. the clothing of men should not be like the dress
~~of women, nor should it be tight or provocative. a muslim should dress
~~to show his identity as a muslim. men are not allowed to wear gold or
~~silk. however, both are allowed for women. for both men and women,
~~clothing requirements are not meant to be a restriction but rather a way
~~in which society will function in a proper, islamic manner 4- لماذا ترث
~~المرأة نصف ما يرث الرجل؟ why do women inherit half of what men get?
~~PageV02P0003
# why do women inherit half of what men get? is a muslim woman's
~~inheritance less than man's inheritance? 1. in the pre-islamic era,
~~women were deprived of the right of inheritance. however, with the avent
~~of islam, they were granted a definite share of the inherited estate,
~~despite the opposition voiced by many arabs at the time, who considered
~~that the right to inheritance was a privilege for men since they
~~defended the tribe and fought its enemies. in some cases in islam the
~~male heir inherits double the inheritance of the female: "god (thus)
~~directs you as regards your children's (inheritance): to the male a
~~portion equal to that of two females". [4/11] a hasty opinion on this
~~matter may consider that such a ruling is injust. however, the faith of
~~islam is completely innocent in this case, since the difference in the
~~inheritance of males and females has nothing to do with favouring males
~~and is based upon the responsibilities which are obligatory for men and
~~not for women. 2. according to islamic law it is a man's religious duty
~~to maintain and provide for his wife, children and other members of his
~~family, which might include his father, mother, and brothers and sisters
~~if they are not able to support themselves. his wife, on the other hand
~~is not charged with any financial responsibilities, and she is not even
~~financially responsible for herself, however wealthy she may be, and her
~~husband is responible for her maintainance. PageV02P0004
# if we understand this, we will realize that when she inherits half of
~~any inheritance, her financial position is still superior to a man's
~~financial position. 3. in this connection it is important to emphasize
~~that there is absolutely no general rule in islam that women should
~~inherit only half of what men inherit. concerning this question of
~~inheritance there is in the qur’an only one rule concerning what
~~children inherit: “god (thus) directs you as regards your children’s
~~(inheritance): to the male a portion equal to that of two females...”.
~~(sure 4/11) but in the whole **** of qur’an and sunna there are only
~~four cases in which the man inherits double, but there are more than 30
~~cases in which the woman either inherits the same as the man or inherits
~~even more or inherits while the man does not inherit anythings. many
~~egyptian christians go to the egyptian islamic centre for legal opinions
~~in order to follow the islamic system of inheritance which settles all
~~disputes between the heirs. source http://islamic-

~~of women in paradise PageV02P0005
# reward of women in paradise jannah or paradise is not for men alone.
~~it is prepared for both, righteous men and righteous women. all the joys
~~and blessings of jannah are for both of them. allah has mentioned in the
~~qur’an that he put both adam and his wife hawwa’ (eve) in jannah after
~~creating them, and he told them to eat and enjoy everything (except the
~~fruit of one tree). [see al-baqarah 2: 35; al-a`raf 7: 19] thus, all the
~~trees, gardens and rivers of jannah are made for both men and women and
~~they both will enjoy them. all believers, males and females, will enter
~~the jannah. allah says, ( gardens of perpetual bliss: they shall enter
~~there, as well as the righteous among their fathers, their spouses, and
~~their offspring) (ar-ra`d 13: 23) further, allah says, (indeed, the
~~people of paradise will be happily occupied. they and their wives shall
~~be in shades, reclining on raised couches. there are for them fruits and
~~there is for them all that they ask for ... ) (ya-sin 36: 55-57) in the
~~hereafter allah will say to the believers, (enter the garden, you and
~~your wives, you will be made glad. there will be brought round for them
~~trays of gold and goblets, and therein is all that the souls desire and
~~eyes find sweet and you will stay there forever. this is the garden,
~~which you are made to inherit because of what you used to do. therein
~~for you is fruit in plenty whence to eat. ) (az-zukhruf 43: 70-73) there
~~are many other places in the qur’an where it is mentioned that men and
~~women both will find their reward and none will be deprived.
~~PageV02P0006
# [see: aal `imran 3: 195; an-nisa’, 4: 124; an-nahl 16: 97; al-ahzab
~~33: 35; ghafir 40: 40] the life of women in jannah will be as pleasant
~~and happy as the life of men. allah is not partial to any gender. he
~~created both of them and he will take care of both of them according to
~~their needs and desires. let us all work to achieve the jannah and then,
~~in sha’ allah, we will find there what will satisfy all of us fully.
~~this verse clearly denotes that those women who do righteous deeds are
~~rewarded with paradise and given a high rank that is equal to the good
~~deeds they have offered. shedding more light on this issue, we'd like to
~~cite the following fatwa issued by the outstanding muslim scholar,
~~sheikh ibn jibreen: there is no doubt that reward in the hereafter
~~encompasses both men and women. this is based on the following qur'anic
~~verses: ( lo! i suffer not the work of any worker, male or female, to be
~~lost) (al `imran 3: 195) (whosoever works righteousness, whether male or
~~female, while he (or she) is a true believer, we will give a good life.
~~) (an-nahl 16: 97) (and whoever does righteous good deeds, being a male
~~or a female, and is a true believer, such will enter paradise. ) (an-
~~nisa 4: 124) (verily, the muslims, men and women, the believers, men and
~~women... allah has prepared for them forgiveness and a great reward. )
~~(al-ahzab 33: 35) allah mentions them entering into paradise together,
~~saying: (they and their wives will be in pleasant shade. ) (ya sin 36:
~~56) (enter paradise, you and your wives, in happiness. ) PageV02P0007
# (az-zukhruf 43: 70) allah also mentions that he will recreate women in
~~paradise in the following verse: ( lo! we have created them a (new)
~~creation. and made them virgins ... ) (al-waqi`ah 56: 35-36) that is,
~~allah will recreate the elderly women and make them virgins; the same
~~will be done for old men, allah will make them youth. it is also
~~mentioned in the hadith that the women of this worldly life have a
~~superiority over al-hur al-`in due to the acts of worship and obedience
~~that they performed in this world. therefore, the believing women will
~~enter paradise just like the believing men. if a woman had a number of
~~husbands, she, upon entering paradise with them, would choose among them
~~the one with the best character and behavior. أساسيات الإيمان basic

# nine great benefits of reading and reflecting over the qur'aan in the
~~name of allaah, the most merciful, may his salaah and salaam be upon his
~~last messenger muhammad, to proceed: indeed the book of allaah is not a
~~book like any other, it is the timeless speech of allaah, not a created
~~thing, a study guide for life and death and what comes after. therefore
~~it deserves a more careful study than anyone else's speech. it
~~necessitates that its reader return to the early narrations of those who
~~witnessed its revelation and heard its explanation by the one deputed by
~~allaah to rehearse and explain his words to humanity (sallallaahu
~~'alayhe wa sallam). for if one would try to ponder over the meanings of
~~the verses without having done this study, then surely the filth of the
~~time that he lives in and his ignorance of the correct application and
~~understanding that the early muslims had would cause him to understand
~~some things not intended by allaah most high, and therefore he would go
~~astray, thinking to be worshipping allaah. so every sincere muslim who
~~hopes to earn allaah's love by reciting and reflecting over allaah's
~~book, then let him hold tight to the meanings explained by the prophet
~~(sallallaahu 'alayhe wan sallam), and those taught by the companions and
~~their immediate followers, and the early scholars of islaam.
~~PageV02P0009
# know that reciting and pondering over the book of allaah, devoting
~~your time regularly to its study and implementation has tremendous
~~benefits in this life and the next, so let us now look to just a few of
~~them to attach ourselves more firmly to allaah's majestic words. each
~~benefit stands as enough of an encouragement on its own for us to shun
~~any laziness we have and dedicate ourselves to the qur'aan properly. 1.
~~- reading and reflecting over the qur'aan fulfills an islaamic duty.
~~indeed the prophet (sallallaahu 'alayhe wa sallam) summarized this
~~religion with his statement: "the religion is naseehah (sincerity)!" so
~~then tameem ibn aws (may allaah be pleased with him) then said, "we
~~asked, 'to whom?'" he (sallallaahu 'alayhe wa sallam) replied: "to
~~allaah, his book, his messenger, the leaders of the people, and their
~~common folk." [saheeh muslim #194 (1/220 of sharh an-nawawee)] the
~~sincerity that is due to the book of allaah, as ibn rajab al- hambalee
~~said, includes having a strong love for it, honoring it and extolling
~~its great status, affirming that it is the speech of allaah, seeking to
~~understand its meanings, acting by it, following the orders found in it,
~~spreading its correct understanding, continually studying it, and taking
~~on the good manners that are encouraged in it. [refer to jaami'ul-uloom
~~wal-hikam, p.221 (ar-risaalah, 1417)] so by reading and reflecting over
~~the qur'aan, one fulfills an obligation and is rewarded for that.
~~PageV02P0010
# upon fulfilling this obligation, the qur'aan then becomes a proof for
~~him on the day of judgment! and that is our second benefit we will take
~~by embracing this noble book... 2. - the qur'aan will be a proof for us
~~on the day of judgment. this is due to the statement of the messenger
~~(sallallaahu 'alayhe wa sallam): "...and the qur'aan is a proof for you
~~or against you..." [part of a hadeeth in saheeh muslim #533 (2/97 of
~~sharh an-nawawee)] so one of two things will occur with this proof, the
~~book of allaah. it will either be in your favor, a proof for you on the
~~day when you will need every single good deed, or it will be something
~~standing against you, the very speech of your creator, a proof against
~~you! who could be saved from the terrors of that day if allaah's own
~~speech is against him?!?! think carefully, dear muslim brother or
~~sister, about your position with the qur'aan! are you neglecting it,
~~contradicting it, being heedless of its orders and prohibitions, are you
~~thinking deeply over it?! will it be on your side on the day of
~~judgment?! "o allaah! we ask you, by your glorious speech and the rest
~~of your beautiful names and attributes, to make the qur'aan a proof for
~~us! o allaah! don't make the qur'aan a proof against us on that day, and
~~save us from the hellfire!" for if allaah makes the qur'aan a proof in
~~our favor on that day, and then it would also be an intercessor for us,
~~when no intercession will take place except by his permission. 3. - the
~~qur'aan will intercede for us on the day of judgment. PageV02P0011
# the proof: aboo umaamah relates that the prophet (sallallaahu 'alayhe
~~wa sallam) said: "read the qur'aan, for verily it will come on the day
~~of standing as an intercessor for its companions." [saheeh muslim #1871
~~(3/330 of sharh an-nawawee)] 4. - your status in this life will be
~~raised. in saheeh muslim, we find a lovely story, about how a man from
~~the promised people of jannah, 'umar ibn al-khattaab, and his deputy
~~over makkah understood this. on the authority of 'aamir ibn waathilah,
~~he said that naafi' ibn 'abdil- haarith met up with 'umar (ibn al-
~~khattaab) at (a place called) 'usfaan. 'umar used to put him (naafi') to
~~work (to govern) over makkah. so he ('umar) said, "who have you put to
~~work (to govern) over the people of the valley (makkah)?" he (naafi')
~~said, "ibn abzaa." he ('umar) said, "who is ibn abzaa?" he (naafi')
~~said, "one of our freed slaves." he ('umar) said, "so you have put a
~~freed slave in charge of them?" he (naafi') said, "verily he is a
~~recitor of the book of allaah, the mighty and majestic, and verily he is
~~knowledgeable of the laws of inheritance." 'umar said, "verily your
~~prophet (sallallaahu 'alayhe wa sallam) had said: "verily allaah raises
~~some people by way of this book and lowers others by it." [saheeh muslim
~~#1894 (3/339 of sharh an-nawawee)] 5. - you will be from the best of the
~~people. PageV02P0012
# 'uthmaan (may allaah be pleased with him), the third khaleefah and
~~fourth most virtuous person on earth after the prophet (sallallaahu
~~'alayhe wa sallam), aboo bakr, and 'umar, said that the prophet
~~(sallallaahu 'alayhe wa sallam) said: "the best of you are the ones who
~~learn the qur'aan and teach it to others" [saheeh al-bukhaaree #5027
~~(9/89-90 of fat-hul-baaree)] 6. - there are ten rewards for each letter
~~you recite from the qur'aan as an authentic hadeeth in sunan at-
~~tirmithee proves: "whoever reads a letter from the book of allaah, he
~~will have a reward. and that reward will be multiplied by ten. i am not
~~saying that "alif, laam, meem" is a letter, rather i am saying that
~~"alif" is a letter, "laam" is a letter, and "meem" is a letter." [sunan
~~at-tirmithee #2910; al-albaanee authenticated it in saheeh sunan at-
~~tirmithee (3/164)] so increase your recitation of the qur'aan to gain
~~these merits, and to gain the following merit as well... 7. - the
~~recitors of the qur'aan will be in the company of the noble and obedient
~~angels. 'aa'ishah (may allaah be pleased with her), the prophet's
~~beloved wife who held his head in her lap as he took his last blessed
~~breaths, relates that the prophet (sallallaahu 'alayhe wa sallam) said:
~~"verily the one who recites the qur'aan beautifully, smoothly, and
~~precisely, he will be in the company of the noble and obedient angels.
~~and as for the one who recites with difficulty, stammering or stumbling
~~through its verses, then he will have twice that reward. PageV02P0013
# " [saheeh muslim #1859 (3/325 of sharh an-nawawee); another version of
~~this hadeeth with a slightly different wording can be found in saheeh
~~al-bukhaaree #4937 (8/852 of fat-hul-baaree)] so do not let the shaytaan
~~give you false excuses, such as "i am not an 'arab," or "it's not my
~~language." this hadeeth is a firm proof against these whisperings.
~~dedicate yourself to the book of allaah, whether you are an 'arab or
~~not! the excuses have been eliminated and the pathway has been cleared
~~for you to embrace the book of allaah without holding back or offering
~~excuses! and surely you will not hesitate to seek a teacher or a study
~~circle for the qur'aan once you hear the last and perhaps greatest
~~benefits of reading and contemplating over the qur'aan... 8. - the
~~qur'aan will lead you to paradise. the prophet (sallallaahu 'alayhe wa
~~sallam) said: "the qur'aan is an intercessor, something given permission
~~to intercede, and it is rightfully believed in. whoever puts it in front
~~of him, it will lead him to paradise; whoever puts it behind him, it
~~will steer him to the hellfire." [an authentic hadeeth found in saheeh
~~ibn hibbaan #124 (1/330-331 of tarteeb ibn balbaan, printed by ar-
~~risaalah), on the authority of 'abdullaah ibn mas'ood; al-albaanee
~~authenticated it in silsilatul-ahaadeethis-saheehah #2019] 9. - your
~~position in paradise is determined by the amount of qur'aan you memorize
~~in this life. PageV02P0014
# 'abdullaah ibn 'amr ibn al-'aas heard the prophet (sallallaahu 'alayhe
~~wa sallam) saying: "it will be said to the companion of the qur'aan:
~~read and elevate (up through the levels of the paradise) and beautify
~~your voice as you used to do when you were in the dunyaa! for verily,
~~your position in the paradise will be at the last verse you recite!"
~~[sunan at-tirmithee #2914; al-albaanee authenticated it in saheeh sunan
~~at-tirmithee (3/164-165)] know that these nine benefits, from the many
~~benefits available, can only be attained by a sincere commitment to the
~~book of allaah, not by a person's mere statement, "i love the qur'aan,
~~it's beautiful." rather the heart must be sincerely attached to allaah's
~~book and the limbs and tongue will follow in this attachment. you must

# ingratitude for god’s blessings maulana wahiduddin khan right from a
~~glass of water to political power, everything that people possess in
~~this world is from god. everything is a direct blessing of god. whatever
~~one finds in this world is there because of the will of god. if god does
~~not will it, no one can have anything, no matter how hard he tries for
~~it. this is an undeniable truth proved by the qur’an and the hadith.
~~another thing that we learn from the qur’an and the hadith is that there
~~are two forms of divine blessing. one special and the other general.
~~political power is a special blessing of god. we learn from the qur’an
~~that political power is not given to everyone. neither can it be
~~received through political movements or the gun culture. it is directly
~~related with the way of god. one of the sunnah of god is that if a group
~~proves, in the real sense of the word, to have true faith and to be
~~virtuous in action, then god grants that group political power: allah
~~has promised those of you who believe and do good works to make them
~~masters in the land (24:55). that is, even when power is desirable, the
~~movement will begin from the point of character building and individual
~~reform instead of political action. then god’s general gift is what is
~~shared, more or less by everyone. in principle, it consists of two kinds
~~of things—peaceful circumstances and the easy availability of the
~~necessities of life. this we learn from the following verse of the
~~qur’an: god has made an example of the city which was once safe and
~~peaceful. PageV02P0017
# its provisions used to come in abundance from every quarter: but its
~~people denied the favors of allah. therefore, he afflicted them with
~~famine and fear as a punishment for what they did. (16:112) two things
~~in this verse are called the blessings of god: peace and provision. it
~~shows that from the worldly point of view these two things are essential
~~for human beings. if a group comes to possess these two things, then it
~~should not wage war for anything else, such as political power. rather
~~considering those blessings to be sufficient, believers should engage
~~themselves in thanksgiving to god, until god himself paves the way for
~~whatever else is to come. what is thanksgiving to god? it is that
~~whatever god has given us should be put to proper religious and
~~constructive use. remaining ******* with what one already has is
~~thanksgiving, whereas regarding what one already possesses as
~~unimportant and launching stormy movements for things not in our
~~possession is ungratefulness. any muslims in possession of both peace
~~and provision ought to occupy themselves with spiritual matters rather
~~than political activities. now is the time to engage themselves in
~~producing spiritual fervor in their people; in launching movements of
~~moral reform; in educating their people; in planning the way to
~~communicate god’s message to other communities; in spending their time
~~in their places of worship, in developing their academic institutions,
~~in setting up their settlements as a model abode of godly people, etc.
~~this is true thanksgiving. this is to pay the due of god’s blessings.
~~PageV02P0018
# a non-believer’s eyes are on his rights while a believer’s eyes are on
~~his responsibilities. that is why an unbeliever is always running for
~~what he has yet to possess, while a believer always engages himself in
~~discharging his responsibilities within his own sphere. those who do not
~~follow the path of thankfulness, launch heated movements towards
~~political goals or revive the gun culture against their supposed
~~enemies. such people are undoubtedly anarchists. their case is one of
~~adding insult to injury, even if their movement has been launched in the
~~name of islam. for such people it is the decree of god that they never
~~reach their political goal, and whatever blessings of peace and worldly
~~provision they have already enjoyed be denied to them. they will lose
~~what they already possess. this is the way of god. الآخرة al-akhirah
~~(the hereafter) PageV02P0019
# al-akhirah (the hereafter) belief in al-akhira, life after death, is
~~so crucial to the islamic faith that a doubt about it amounts to the
~~denial of allah. allah's own word in the holy qur'an is the foundation
~~of this faith. besides, the prophet has explained the centrality of this
~~belief for a person who wishes to lead an islamic life. we know that we
~~have no means of knowing life after death as a perceptual experience.
~~but allah has given us certain levels of consciousness that give us
~~insight into realities not perceptible through the senses. the holy
~~qur'an speaks to our rational mind when it answers the question of the
~~disbelievers: "who will give life to the dead bones?" say: "he who
~~created you first! then will they wag their heads towards you and say,
~~'when will that be?' say, 'may be it will be quite soon!' it will be on
~~a day when he will call you, and you will answer [his call] with [words
~~of his praise, and you will think that you tarried but a little while!"
~~(17: 51, 52) in the holy qur'an, allah appeals to man's reasoning and
~~addresses his power of reflection and judgment in the following verses:
~~"then behold [o man!] the tokens of allah's mercy! - how he gives life
~~to the earth after its death: verily the same will give life to the men
~~who are dead: for he has power over all things" (30: 50) "it is allah
~~who sends forth the winds, so that they raise up the clouds, and we
~~drive them to a land that is dead, and revive the earth therewith after
~~its death: even so [will be] the resurrection!" (35: 9). PageV02P0020
# "and among his signs is this: you see the earth humble; but when we
~~send down rain to it, it is stirred to life and yields increase. truly,
~~he who gives life to the (dead) earth can surely give life to (men) who
~~are dead. for he has power over all things" (41: 39). all these verses
~~clearly emphasize how the dead earth is revived by god. this is
~~something that is obvious to us, but if so, how can we deny the truth of
~~the resurrection, when the almighty god can easily revive the dead
~~bones? comparing two groups of people (e.g. those who are going to get
~~the highest reward from allah and those who are to receive his
~~punishment in the hereafter) allah asks: "are [these two] alike? - one
~~to whom we have made a goodly promise, and who is going to reach its
~~[fulfillment], and one to whom we have given the good things of this
~~life, but who, on the day of judgment, is to be among those brought up
~~[for punishment]?" (28: 61). speaking of the fate of those who used to
~~deny the day of judgment, allah says: "until, when death comes to one of
~~them, he says: 'o my lord! send me back [to life], in order that i may
~~work righteousness in the things i neglected.' - 'by no means! it is but
~~a word he says.'- before them is a partition till the day they are
~~raised up. then when the trumpet is blown, there will be no more
~~relationships between them that day, nor will one ask after another!
~~then those whose balance [of good deeds] is heavy, they will be
~~successful: but those whose balance is light, will be those who have
~~lost their souls, in hell will they abide ... " (23:99-104).
~~PageV02P0021
# belief in the life after death encourages a person to lead a good life
~~on earth, since he knows the fate that awaits him if he ignores the
~~commands and warnings of allah given in the qur'an. in fact, belief in
~~the hereafter is the strongest incentive for a person to lead a life of
~~virtue while here on earth. the real road to a peaceful society can be
~~paved only if people believe in the hereafter. source

# the rites of worship this section deals with the four primary forms of
~~worship, which are prayer, the zakâh tax, fasting, and the hajj
~~pilgrimage. these four acts of worship, along with the testimony that
~~there is no god but allah and that muhammad is the messenger of allah,
~~are the five pillars that islam rests upon. allah’s messenger (may the
~~peace and blessings of allah be upon him) said: “islam is built upon
~~five things: testifying that there is no god but allah and that muhammad
~~is the messenger of allah, establishing prayer, paying the zakâh tax,
~~fasting during the month of ramadân, and making pilgrimage to the house
~~if one is able to do so.” these four pillars are the minimum required
~~acts of worship. negligence in performing these acts of worship is
~~considered a major sin and can lead to apostasy. islamic law encourages
~~the believer to perform more than these acts of worship in order for the
~~believer to become even nearer to allah. the prophet (may the peace and
~~blessings of allah be upon him) relates that allah said: “my servant
~~does not seek nearness to me with anything more beloved than what i have
~~commanded him to do. my servant then continues to seek nearness to me
~~with voluntary acts until i love him.” these acts of worship are as old
~~as they are new: acts of worship similar to these were prescribed in the
~~religions that came before islam. they were an integral part of those
~~faiths. allah says, referring to some of the messengers (peace be upon
~~them): “and we made them leaders that guided people by our command.
~~PageV02P0023
# we inspired them to perform good deeds, establish prayer, and pay the
~~zakâh, and they were to us devout worshippers.” allah says, after
~~speaking about mûsâ (moses), ibrâhîm (abraham), ishâq (isaac), and
~~ya`qûb (jacob, peace be upon them all): “o you who believe, fasting is
~~prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those who came before you
~~that perhaps you might be god fearing.” allah says regarding the hajj
~~pilgrimage: “and when we gave to ibrâhîm (abraham) the site of the house
~~(saying): do not associate with me anything in worship, and sanctify my
~~house for those who circle it, or stand up, bow, and prostrate in
~~prayer. and proclaim the pilgrimage to the people; they will come to you
~~on foot, on every lean camel, and from every steep mountain pass.”
~~necessarily, the exact forms taken by these acts of worship were
~~different for the previous manifestations of the sacred law. the manner
~~of prayer in islam is different than it was for the jews and christians.
~~the same can be said about alms, fasting, and pilgrimage. effects of
~~these four acts of worship: these acts of worship, though they are pure
~~acts of devotion that must be carried out no matter how restricted the
~~worshipper’s understanding of them might be, have wisdom behind them.
~~knowing the wisdom behind them and the positive effects that they bring
~~about can increase the worshipper’s resolve and zeal in performing them.
~~this knowledge can increase the benefit realized by the worshipper as

# nine great benefits of reading and reflecting over the qur'aan basic
~~tenets of faith faith (aqeedah) is the firm creed that a muslim's heart
~~must be fixed upon, without any wavering or doubt. it excludes any
~~supposition, doubt or suspicion. the arabic word “aqeedah” is derived
~~from the root ‘aqada, which conveys meanings of certainty, affirmation,
~~confirmation, etc. allah says: (allah will not punish you for what is
~~unintentional in your oaths, but he will punish you for your deliberate
~~oaths) [qur’an 5:87] the "deliberate oaths" refers to the determination
~~that someone has deep down in his/her heart. the whole verse means that
~~allah will not punish people for their unintentional beliefs or deeds,
~~but he will punish them for what they deliberately mean, whether in
~~their deeds or intentions. also allah says: (o you who believe! give
~~your response to allah and his messenger when he calls you to that which
~~will give you life, and know that allah comes in between a man and his
~~heart, and it is he to whom you shall all be gathered.) [qur’an 8:24] in
~~islam, faith, (iman or aqeedah) is the matter of knowledge. the muslim
~~must believe in his heart and have faith and conviction, with no doubts
~~or suspicions. the islamic “aqeedah” is established on the principle
~~that "there is no deity worthy of worship except allah, and muhammad is
~~the messenger of allah". the principles of “aaqeedah” are those which
~~allah has ordered muslims to believe in. allah (swt) says: (the
~~messenger believes in what has been sent down to him from his lord, and
~~(so do) the believers. PageV02P0025
# each one believes in allah, his angels, his books and his messengers.
~~they say, ‘we make no distinction between one and another of his
~~messengers’ – and they say, ‘we hear, and we obey. (we seek) your
~~forgiveness, our lord, and to you is the return (of all)) [qur’an 2:285]
~~prophet muhammad (pbuh) described how jebreel explained faith in islam
~~to him; “faith is to believe in allah, his angels, his books, his
~~messengers, and the day of resurrection." allah says: (and thus we
~~inspired in you (muhammad) a spirit of our command. you did not know
~~what the ******ure was, nor what the faith (iman) was. but we have made
~~it a light whereby we guide whom we will of our bondmen...) [qur’an
~~42:52] the basic principles that muslims must believe in and follow are
~~the five pillars of islam. one will not be called a believer just by
~~knowing and understanding these pillars but he must come to the level
~~where he submits and implements them. iman, in this manner, incorporates
~~islam. imam abu-hanifa said, "the understanding of faith is better than
~~understanding of the science." what he meant by faith here is the
~~“tawheed” (believing that there is no good but allah (set)) and he meant
~~“shariah” by science. it is clear that he put the understanding of
~~“tawheed”, which is the foundation of the islamic faith, before the
~~understanding of the “shariah”. also, sheikh al-haruwi al-ansari said in
~~his book, “itiqad ahl al-sunnah”; "the first obligation upon the slave
~~is the knowledge of allah." this is also proven in prophet muhammad's
~~(pbuh) saying; “you will come to people from the people of the book.

~~الإسلام moral system of islam PageV02P0027
# moral system of islam islam has laid down some universal fundamental
~~rights for humanity as a whole, which are to be observed and respected
~~under all circumstances. to achieve these rights islam provides not only
~~legal safeguards but also a very effective moral system. thus whatever
~~leads to the welfare of the individual or the society is morally good in
~~islam and whatever is injurious is morally bad. islam attaches so much
~~importance to the love of god and love of man that it warns against too
~~much of formalism. we read in the quran: "it is not righteousness that
~~you turn your faces towards east or west; but it is righteousness to
~~believe in god and the last day and the angels, and the book, and the
~~messengers; to spend of your substance, out of love for him, for your
~~kin, for orphans for the needy, for the wayfarer, for those who ask; and
~~for the freeing of captives; to be steadfast in prayers, and practice
~~regular charity; to fulfill the contracts which you made; and to be firm
~~and patient in pain (or suffering) and adversity and throughout all
~~periods of panic. such are the people of truth, the god-conscious."
~~(2:177) we are given a beautiful de******ion of the righteous and god-
~~conscious man in these verses. he should obey salutary regulations, but
~~he should fix his gaze on the love of god and the love of his fellow
~~men. PageV02P0028
# we are given four heads: our faith should be true and sincere, we must
~~be prepared to show it in deeds of charity to our fellow-men, we must be
~~good citizens, supporting social organizations, and our own individual
~~soul must be firm and unshaken in all circumstances. this is the
~~standard by which a particular mode of conduct is judged and classified
~~as good or bad. this standard of judgment provides the nucleus around
~~which the whole moral conduct should revolve. before laying down any
~~moral injunctions islam seeks to firmly implant in man's heart the
~~conviction that his dealings are with god who sees him at all times and
~~in all places; that he may hide himself from the whole world but not
~~from him; that he may deceive everyone but cannot deceive god; that he
~~can flee from the clutches of anyone else but not from god. thus, by
~~setting god's pleasure as the objective of man's life, islam has
~~furnished the highest possible standard of morality. this is bound to
~~provide limitless avenues for the moral evolution of humanity. by making
~~divine revelations as the primary source of knowledge it gives
~~permanence and stability to the moral standards which afford reasonable
~~scope for genuine adjustments, adaptations and innovations, though not
~~for perversions, wild variation, atomistic relativism or moral fluidity.
~~it provides a sanction to morality in the love and fear of god, which
~~will impel man to obey the moral law even without any external pressure.
~~PageV02P0029
# through belief in god and the day of judgment it furnishes a force
~~which enables a person to adopt the moral conduct with earnestness and
~~sincerity, with all the devotion of heart and soul. it does not, through
~~a false sense of originality and innovation, provide any novel moral
~~virtues nor does it seek to minimize the importance of the well-known
~~moral norms, nor does it give exaggerated importance to some and neglect
~~others without cause. it takes up all the commonly known moral virtues
~~and with a sense of balance and proportion it assigns a suitable place
~~and function to each one of them in the total scheme of life. it widens
~~the scope of man's individual and collective life - his domestic
~~associations, his civic conduct, and his activities in the political,
~~economic, legal, educational, and social realms. it covers his life from
~~home to society, from the dining-table to the battlefield and peace
~~conferences, literally from the cradle to the grave. in short, no sphere
~~of life is exempt from the universal and comprehensive application of
~~the moral principles of islam. it makes morality reign supreme and
~~ensures that the affairs of life, instead of dominated by selfish
~~desires and petty interests, should be regulated by norms of morality.
~~it stipulates for man a system of life which is based on all good and is
~~free from all evil. it invokes the people, not only to practice virtue,
~~but also to establish virtue and eradicate vice, to bid good and to
~~forbid wrong. PageV02P0030
# it wants that the verdict of conscience should prevail and virtue must
~~not be subdued to play second fiddle to evil. those who respond to this
~~call are gathered together into a community and given the name "muslim".
~~and the singular object underlying the formation of this community
~~("ummah") is that it should make an organized effort to establish and
~~enforce goodness and suppress and eradicate evil. here we furnish some
~~basic moral teachings of islam for various aspects of a muslim's life.
~~they cover the broad spectrum of personal moral conduct of a muslim as
~~well as his social responsibilities. source http://www.al-
~~sunnah.com/moral_system_of_islam.htm الله جميل يحب الجمال allah is
~~beautiful & loves beauty PageV02P0031
# allah is beautiful & loves beauty from 'abdullaah ibn mas'ood
~~(radiyallaahu 'anhu) who said that the prophet (sallallaahu 'alayhi wa
~~sallam) said, "no one will enter paradise who has an atom's weight of
~~pride in his heart." a man said, "what if a man likes his clothes to
~~look good and his shoes to look good?" he said, "allaah is beautiful and
~~loves beauty. pride means denying the truth and looking down on
~~people."...... ibnul-qayyim (d.751h) - may allah bless him- said,
~~commenting upon this hadeeth: ''the phrase 'allaah is beautiful and
~~loves beauty,' includes the beautiful clothing which was asked about in
~~the same hadeeth. it is included by way of generalization, meaning that
~~beauty in all things is what is meant here. in saheeh muslim, it says:
~~"allaah is good and only accepts that which is good." in sunanut-
~~tirmidhee it says: "allaah loves to see the effects of his blessing on
~~his slave.'' it was reported that abul-ahwas al-jashamee said: the
~~prophet (sallallaahu 'alayhi wa sallam) saw me wearing old, tattered
~~clothes, and asked me, "do you have any wealth?" i said, "yes." he said,
~~"what kind of wealth?" i said, "all that allaah has given me of camels
~~and sheep." he said, "then show the generous blessings that he has given
~~you." allaah, may he be glorified, loves the effects of his blessings to
~~his slave to be made manifest, for this is part of the beauty that he
~~loves, and that is part of the gratitude for his blessings which forms
~~an inner beauty (beauty of character). PageV02P0032
# allaah loves to see the external beauty of his slaves which reflects
~~his blessings on them, and the inner beauty of their gratitude to him
~~for those blessings. because he loves beauty, he sends down on his
~~slaves clothes and adornments with which they may make their outward
~~appearance beautiful and he gives them taqwaa which makes their inner
~~characters beautiful. allaah says: "o children of adam! we have bestowed
~~raiment upon you to cover yourselves (screen your private parts, etc.)
~~and as an adornment, and the raiment of righteousness, that is better."
~~[sooratul-a'raaf 7:26] and he says, speaking of the people of paradise:
~~".and he gave them nadrataan (a light of beauty) and joy. and their
~~recompense shall be paradise and silken garments, because they were
~~patient." [sooratul-insaan 76:11-12] their faces will be made beautiful
~~with the nadrah (light of beauty), their innermost being with joy and
~~their bodies with silken garments. just as allaah loves beauty in words,
~~deeds, garments and outward appearance, so he hates ugliness in words,
~~deeds, garments and outward appearance. he hates ugliness and its
~~people, and loves beauty and its people. but two groups are misguided
~~with regard to this issue: a group who say that everything that he has
~~created is beautiful, so he loves all that he has created and we should
~~love all that he has created and not hate anything. they say: whoever
~~realizes that all that exists comes from him will see that it is
~~beautiful. PageV02P0033
# these people have no sense of jealousy for the sake of allaah or
~~hatred and enmity for the sake of allaah, or denouncing what is evil
~~(munkar), or jihaad (struggle) for the sake of allaah, or adhering his
~~limits. they regard the beauty of images, male or female, as being part
~~of the beauty that allaah loves, and seek to worship allaah through
~~immoral acts. some of them may even go so far as to claim that the one
~~whom they worship is manifested or incarnated in those images. the
~~second group, on the other hand, say that allaah condemns the beauty of
~~images, forms and outward appearances. allaah says about the munaafiqoon
~~(hypocrites): "and when you look at them, their bodies please you."
~~[sooratul-munaafiqoon 63:4] "and how many a generation have we destroyed
~~before them. who were better in wealth, goods and outward appearance?"
~~[soorah maryam 19:54] in saheeh muslim it is reported that the prophet
~~(sallallaahu 'alayhi wa sallam) said: "allaah does not look at your
~~outward appearance and your wealth, rather he looks at your hearts and
~~deeds." according to another hadeeth: "shabbiness is part of faith."
~~allaah condemns those who are extravagant, which applies to extravagance
~~in clothing as well as in food and drink. in order to settle this
~~dispute, we may say that beauty in clothing and outward appearance is of
~~three types, one of which is commendable, one is blameworthy and one of
~~which is neither. PageV02P0034
# the kind of beauty which is to be commended is that which is done for
~~the sake of allaah, to help one to obey allaah and fulfil his commands,
~~such as when the prophet (sallallaahu 'alayhi wa sallam) made himself
~~look beautiful (i.e. handsome) when meeting the delegations that came to
~~him. this is like wearing armour or battle-dress when fighting, or
~~wearing silk and showing off (in front of the enemy). this is
~~commendable because it is done to make the word of allaah supreme and to
~~support his religion and annoy his enemies. the blameworthy kind of
~~beauty is that which is done for the sake of this world, for reasons of
~~power, false pride and showing off, or to fulfil some (selfish) desires.
~~this also includes cases where beauty is an end in itself for a person
~~and is all he cares about. many people have no other concern in life. as
~~for the kind of beauty which is neither commendable nor blameworthy, it
~~is that which has nothing to do with either of the two purposes
~~mentioned above (i.e., it is neither for the sake of allaah nor for the
~~sake of worldly purposes). the hadeeth under discussion refers to two
~~important principles, knowledge and behaviour. allaah is to be
~~acknowledged for beauty that bears no resemblance to anything else, and
~~he is to be worshipped by means of the beauty which he loves in words,
~~deeds and attitudes. PageV02P0035
# he loves his slaves to beautify their tongues with the truth, to
~~beautify their hearts with sincere devotion (ikhlaas), love, repentance
~~and trust in him, to beautify their faculties with obedience, and to
~~beautify their bodies by showing his blessings upon them in their
~~clothing and by keeping them pure and free of any filth, dirt or
~~impurity, by removing the hairs which should be removed, by
~~circumcision, and by clipping the nails. thus they recognize allaah
~~through these qualities of beauty and seek to draw close to him through
~~beautiful words, deeds and attitudes. they acknowledge him for the
~~beauty which is his attribute and they worship him through the beauty
~~which he has prescribed and his religion. the hadeeth combines these two
~~principles of knowledge and behaviour.'' source

# always remember: " ... allah knows and you know not." [24:19] allah
~~disposes of everything as he wills, and commands as he wills: "he is not
~~to be questioned about what he does, though they are subject to his
~~questioning." [21"23] if wealth and happiness are destined for you, they
~~will come to you at their appointed time according to the divine decree
~~of allah, the lord of the heavens and the earth. do not be greedy but be
~~moderate because you will receive all that was written for you. if you
~~do so, you will earn the displeasure of the all mighty, and lose all
~~spiritual comfort in this life. maalik ibn deenaar once said: "if you
~~want to acquire true knowledge of allah, the all mighty, then consent to
~~his management and planning. make not your mind and desire, passion or
~~will associates to him." o you of sound health but weak heart! wake up
~~and run to your creator with repentance on your tongue, tears in your
~~eyes, and sincerity in your heart. cry before him, before others cry for
~~you. make haste, o heedless one! "has not the time come for the hearts
~~of those who believe to be affected by allah's reminder ... ?" [57:16]
~~remove the veils of darkness that have corroded your heart. adorn it
~~with his fear and love. do you not fear the moment when you will stand
~~before your lord? there will be no screen between him and you, nor an
~~interpreter to translate for you. and your creator will question you.
~~you will find nothing to your left nor to your right but the blazing
~~fire of hell. PageV02P0038
# do what the prophet of allah advised you, if you truly fear allah: "
~~... so let each of you protect himself against hell-fire, be it even
~~with half a date - and if he finds not, then with a kind word." you are
~~the servant, he is the master. prayers come from you, answers come from
~~him. abstinence comes from you, protection comes from him. repentance
~~comes from you, acceptance comes from him. go towards him walking, he
~~will come to you running. make your deeds pure for his sake alone, and
~~he will extend his mercy to you. upload his religion, and he will extend
~~his bounty to you. follow the sunnah of his beloved, and he will extend
~~his love to you. look forward to your meeting with allah. it will be
~~very soon. sooner than you can imagine! make preparations for this
~~meeting. get rid of the love of this world from your heart; free it from
~~everything other than the lord of truth. do not buy the world and pay
~~with the hereafter as a price. do not sell the hereafter to acquire this
~~world. " ... shall we tell you who are the greatest losers in whatever
~~they may do? those whose efforts have been wasted in this life while
~~they thought they were acquiring good by their deeds ... " [18:103-104]
~~the most wise did not create you to gratify your base desires and
~~passions, nor did he create you for fun, amusement, eating, drinking,
~~sleeping, or having sex! "i have created the jinns and the humans solely
~~to worship me." [51:56] but you are so heedless as if you have drunk the
~~elixir of immortality. PageV02P0039
# you think that the angel of death will never squeeze your soul out of
~~your body? you have forgotten that you will pass through the siraat with
~~the intense fire of hell underneath you. you are unaware of the
~~thrashing that awaits you in your grave by the angels of allah. hot
~~stones of jahannam for you to walk on, herbage bitter than aloes, foul
~~putrid meat to eat, your lips to be cut by coarse scissors, getting
~~trampled under the feet of the people of pharaoh, screaming with your
~~mouths wide open while the hot coals that you devoured come out of your
~~anuses, cutting your own flesh from the sides to eat it, scratching your
~~chests and faces with brass nails - all this awaits you if you do not
~~pay the zakah, if you fornicate, devour usury, slander others, backbite,
~~or malign people's honor. this is just the grave, hell is yet to come! "
~~... the punishment of the hereafter is greater, if they but knew."

~~greatness of allah PageV02P0040
# greatness of allah the following speech was given by a scholar last
~~week. here is the summary: the shaikh said that our actions are based on
~~how much belief we have in our hearts. if our belief is strong, then our
~~actions will be strong. then he mentioned that every effort has a name,
~~a place where it is done and a result. for example, farming is a name of
~~an effort. farming is done on land and the result is fruits, vegetables,
~~etc. similarly, da'wah il-allah (calling people towards allah) is a name
~~of an effort. it is done on the hearts of people and the result is
~~guidence (hidaya) from allah. then the shaikh discussed about the
~~greatness of allah. he said that if two students come to a teacher with
~~questions and starts asking at the same time, no matter how
~~knowledgeable the teacher is, he will tell one student to talk at a
~~time. because, he is unable to understand both at the same time. but on
~~the other hand, allah told us that if the first human being till the
~~last one to born along with all the jinns, if they were to gather in a
~~field and start asking from allah, allah can hear all of them at the
~~same time and reply to all of them at the same time. even though the
~~people are speaking in their own languages, in own tone and ways, yet
~~allah is able to hear and understand them all. allahu akbar! if a
~~student is far away from the teacher and talks, then the teacher has
~~problems understanding what the student is saying. however, no matter
~~how far we are, allah can hear us, distance doesn't affect the hearing
~~of allah. PageV02P0041
# allah is able to see what is under the water of the ocean and what is
~~under the dark soil of the ground. if you are walking with some friends
~~and suddenly you look at something haraam, the friends might not have
~~seen you doing it but allah has seen the treachery of the eyes and he
~~knows what the hearts conceal. allah knows how many hairs there are on
~~your head and on the head of each individual on earth. he knows how many
~~hairs have fallen and how many hairs will grow. he knows how many hairs
~~will turn grey. this great, all mighty, allah didn't keep our success in
~~wealth. he kept our success in following islam. people used to look at
~~karoon and say: how lucky is karoon. if we only had this much wealth.
~~however, allah ta'ala showed the whole mankind that the same wealth
~~brought destruction to karoon for not obeying the commandments of allah.
~~success is not in strength. the people of 'ad were very powerful. they
~~used to say "who is stronger than us?" allah sent them a messenger to
~~remind them that "don't they think that he who has created them is
~~stronger than them?" but the people refused the messenger. allah sent
~~strong wind which destroyed each and every one of them. not even one of
~~them was alive. now who is stronger? allah is able to protect in any
~~condition. when ferawoon decided to kill all the boys born in bani
~~israel, his ministers approached him saying that these are the boys who
~~grow up and become our slaves. if he is going to kill them then who is
~~going to serve us? then ferawoon decided that one year he will kill and
~~another year he won't. PageV02P0042
# if allah wanted, he could've made musa (as) born in the year when
~~ferawoon was not killing. but musa (as) was born in the year when
~~ferawoon was killing. and harun (as), musa (as)'s brother, was born in
~~the year when ferawoon wasn't killing. and allah protected musa (as). we
~~cannot see iman (faith) but we can see the effects of iman. for example,
~~we cannot see wind but we can see the effects of wind (branches of trees
~~moving, our hairs flying, etc.) the same way, the effect of iman is that
~~we do good deeds. an old man being able to get up for tahajjud in a
~~winter night shows us the effect of iman. the shaikh said that he
~~attended a janaza last monday where a whole family had died. the brother
~~who died used to be extremely rich and owned his own private plane. he
~~was going to visit some place with his family (himself, wife, two sons
~~and two daughters). the plane crashed on the way and all of them died.
~~the moment before boarding the plane, he didn't know what was to come.
~~today, our death shroud could already be in the store yet we have big
~~big plans. may allah give us the understanding of this worldly life
~~which is nothing but a deception. if you live in toronto, you can hear
~~weekly lectures like this in medinah masjid. it's every saturday after

~~mercy of allaah towards his slaves PageV02P0043
# the mercy of allaah towards his slaves question : how merciful is
~~allah, because i heard he loves you more than 70 mothers. is that true?
~~please explain?. answer : praise be to allaah. allaah is the most
~~merciful, most compassionate, and he is the most merciful of those who
~~show mercy. his mercy encompasses all things. allaah says
~~(interpretation of the meaning): “and my mercy embraces all things”
~~[al-a’raaf 7:156] in saheeh muslim it is narrated from abu hurayrah that
~~the prophet (peace and blessings of allaah be upon him) said: “allaah
~~has one hundred parts of mercy, of which he sent down one between the
~~jinn, mankind, the animals and the insects, by means of which they are
~~compassionate and merciful to one another, and by means of which wild
~~animals are kind to their offspring. and allaah has kept back ninety-
~~nine parts of mercy with which to be merciful to his slaves of the day
~~of resurrection.” muslim, al-tawbah, 6908. it was narrated that ‘umar
~~ibn al-khattaab said: “some prisoners were brought to the messenger of
~~allaah (peace and blessings of allaah be upon him), and there was a
~~woman among the prisoners who was searching (for her child). when she
~~found her child she embraced him and put him to her breast. the
~~messenger of allaah (peace and blessings of allaah be upon him) said to
~~us, ‘do you think that this woman would throw her child in the fire?’ we
~~said, ‘no, by allaah, not if she is able not to.’ the messenger of
~~allaah (peace and blessings of allaah be upon him) said, ‘allaah is more
~~merciful to his slaves than this woman is to her child.’” agreed upon.
~~PageV02P0044
# al-bukhaari, 5653; muslim, 6912. one aspect of the mercy of allaah to
~~his slaves is that he sent the messengers and revealed the books and
~~laws to organize their lives according to the ways of wisdom, far
~~removed from hardship and difficulty. allaah says (interpretation of the
~~meaning): “and we have sent you (o muhammad) not but as a mercy for the
~~‘aalameen (mankind, jinn and all that exists)” [al-anbiya’ 21:107] the
~~mercy of allaah is what will admit his believing slaves to paradise on
~~the day of resurrection. no one will ever enter paradise because of his
~~deeds alone, as the prophet (peace and blessings of allaah be upon him)
~~said: “no one’s deeds will ever admit him to paradise.” they said, “not
~~even you, o messenger of allaah?” he said, “no, not even me, unless
~~allaah shower me with his mercy. so try to be near to perfection. and no
~~one should wish for death; he is either doing good so he will do more of
~~that, or he is doing wrong so he may repent.” narrated by al-bukhaari,
~~5349; muslim, 7042 so the believer must remain in a state between hoping
~~for the mercy of allaah and fearing his punishment, for allaah says
~~(interpretation of the meaning): “declare (o muhammad) unto my slaves,
~~that truly, i am the oft forgiving, the most merciful. and that my
~~torment is indeed the most painful torment” [al-hijr 15:49-50] with
~~regard to your saying that allaah loves us more than seventy mothers,
~~allaah knows best concerning that. it is sufficient for us to know that
~~the mercy of allaah encompasses all things. o allaah, have mercy upon
~~us, o most merciful of those who show mercy. PageV02P0045
# source http://63.175.194.25/ لا تيأس من عفو الله never despair never
~~despair one might say: “i want to repent, but who can guarantee that
~~allah will forgive me if i do so? i want to follow the straight path,
~~but i feel very hesitant. if i knew for sure that allah would forgive
~~me, i would definitely repent.” i would say in response that these
~~feelings of hesitation are the same as those experienced by the
~~companions of the prophet (peace and blessings be upon him). if you
~~think seriously about the following two reports, such feelings will
~~disappear in sha’ allah. imam muslim reported the story of how `amr ibn
~~al-`aas came to islam: “when allah put the love of islam into my heart,
~~i came to the prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) and said:
~~‘stretch forth your hand so that i may give pledge of allegiance to you.
~~he stretched forth his hand but i pulled my own hand back. he asked,
~~‘what is the matter, o `amr?' i said, ‘there is a condition.’ he asked,
~~‘what is the condition?’ i said: ‘that i be forgiven.’ he said: ‘do you
~~not know, o `amr, that islam wipes out whatever came before, hijrah
~~(migration for the sake of allah) wipes out whatever came before, and
~~hajj wipes out whatever came before?’” imam muslim reported from ibn
~~`abbas that some people among the disbelievers killed a great deal and
~~they committed adultery a great deal. then they came to muhammad (peace
~~and blessings be upon him) and said: “what you say and advocate is good,
~~if only you could tell us that there is any expiation for what we have
~~done. PageV02P0046
# ” then allah revealed the words: [and those who invoke not any other
~~god along with allah, nor kill such life as allah has forbidden, except
~~for just cause, nor commit illegal sexual intercourse – and whoever does
~~this shall receive the punishment.] (al-furqan 25: 68); [say: ‘o my
~~slaves who have transgressed against themselves (by committing evil
~~deeds and sins)! despair not of the mercy of allah.] (az-zumar 39: 53)

~~2004/05.shtml لماذا يجب علينا حب رسول الله عليه الصلاة والسلام why we
~~have to love our prophet muhammad the most PageV02P0047
# why we have to love our prophet muhammad the most question : a child
~~is asking why we have to love and respect our prophet muhammad (peace
~~and blessings of allaah be upon him) the most. answer : praise be to
~~allaah. we welcome you to our website and ask allaah to cause you and
~~all the children of the muslims to grow well; may he help your parents
~~to give you a sound islamic upbringing so that you can carry the banner
~~of faith and be heroes of this religion. i ask you: if you love to play,
~~but your father tells you not to play at certain times because of your
~~studies, what would you do? if you truly love your father, you will do
~~as he asks, even though you love to play. if you are afraid that your
~~father will punish you, and you know that he punishes the one who does
~~not listen to what he says, then you will stop playing and go study. if
~~you expect a gift or a reward from your father when you study or do
~~well, then you will stop yourself playing sometimes, and you will put up
~~with the trouble of studying, because of the reward you hope to earn.
~~the bounty of allaah is greater than anything that our fathers and
~~mothers and all people can give us. all the good things that we and our
~~parents have come from allaah. allaah says (interpretation of the
~~meaning): “and whatever of blessings and good things you have, it is
~~from allaah” [al-nahl 16:53] the reward that allaah has prepared for
~~those who obey him is the greatest of rewards: paradise. PageV02P0048
# allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “allaah has promised
~~those who believe (in the oneness of allaah — islamic monotheism) and do
~~deeds of righteousness, that for them there is forgiveness and a great
~~reward (i.e. paradise)” [al-maa'idah 5:9] the punishment that he has
~~prepared for those who disobey him is the worst of punishments. allaah
~~says (interpretation of the meaning): “and whosoever disobeys allaah and
~~his messenger (muhammad), and transgresses his limits, he will cast him
~~into the fire, to abide therein; and he shall have a disgraceful
~~torment” [al-nisa’ 4:14] obeying allaah can only be achieved by obeying
~~his messenger (peace and blessings of allaah be upon him). allaah says
~~(interpretation of the meaning): “he who obeys the messenger (muhammad),
~~has indeed obeyed allaah, but he who turns away, then we have not sent
~~you (o muhammad) as a watcher over them” [al-nisa’ 4:80] so you can only
~~enter paradise by obeying the prophet (peace and blessings of allaah be
~~upon him). al-tirmidhi (2860) narrated that jaabir (may allaah be
~~pleased with him) said: the messenger of allaah (peace and blessings of
~~allaah be upon him) came out to us one day and said: “in my dream i saw
~~jibreel by my head and mikaa’eel at my feet. one of them said to the
~~other: ‘let us tell him an parable.’ he said: ‘let your ears hear and
~~let your heart understand. the likeness of you and your ummah is that of
~~a king who took some land and built a house on it, then he placed a
~~table therein and sent a messenger inviting the people to come and eat.
~~PageV02P0049
# some of them responded to the messenger and others did not. allaah is
~~the king, the land is islam, the house is paradise, and you, o muhammad,
~~are a messenger. whoever responds to you enters islam, and whoever
~~enters islam will enter paradise, and whoever enters paradise will eat
~~what is therein.’” see al-silsilah al-saheehah by al-albaani, 3595. now
~~you know why we have to love the prophet (peace and blessings of allaah
~~be upon him) and respect him the most. it is because he is the one who
~~showed us the path to paradise. we cannot enter paradise unless we
~~follow him (peace and blessings of allaah be upon him) and follow his
~~sunnah. paradise is the greatest thing that the muslim can hope for and
~~strive for. now i shall tell you of the practical way of expressing this
~~love and obedience: you must have heard the story of the hijrah
~~(migration) of the prophet (peace and blessings of allaah be upon him),
~~from your father or in the mosque where you pray, or from your teacher
~~at school. i ask you: if ‘ali ibn abi taalib (may allaah be pleased with
~~him) did not love the prophet (peace and blessings of allaah be upon
~~him) the most, and also respect and obey him the most, would he have
~~been able to undertake this dangerous mission? finally, we thank you for
~~this important question and for your keenness to learn. we have answered
~~the question a little differently in question no. [14250]. please ask
~~your father to explain this answer to you. may allaah help us all to
~~reach the highest level of faith, and bring us to paradise by his mercy.

# الإسلام هو البديل الصحيح (لعيش حياة متطورة) islam! - the modern
~~alternative islam! - the modern alternative some people think that to
~~live an islamic life is "restrictive". islam however, was revealed as a
~~balanced way of living. allah (the most high) created all the humans
~~with what is called 'a fitrah' (a natural state/desire) [1] islam
~~recognises that within this fitrah there are motivations that influence
~~a man's role on earth e.g. a desire for good food and drink, to have a
~~home, a desire for love and sex, to protect and be protected and to be
~~successful and strong. without some form of control and limit, all of
~~these legitimate motives could prove very dangerous. so what constitutes
~~the perfect control for the fitrah? it must be a method that provides an
~~organised yet practical demonstration of how to balance all these
~~natural human desires. it cannot be something that goes against the
~~fitrah, by placing on it extra burdens. likewise, it cannot be something
~~that allows the human desires to run wild without any form of control.
~~islam is the perfect control for the fitrah. it provides a divine method
~~that elevates man above animals and the rest of creation. limited wisdom
~~humans lack perfect knowledge as well as perfect wisdom. no matter how
~~hard we try, we will never attain the perfect way of life by our own
~~thinking and interpretation. this is the reason why allaah being the
~~most wise, sent us the qur'an and the prophet muhammad (saw)[2] to show
~~us this practical and organised way of life. PageV02P0051
# allaah, being perfect, in his wisdom and knowledge, perfected a
~~complete way of life for us. he has set his limitations and rules, all
~~of which are beneficial to mankind, and therefore, do not need changing:
~~"these are the limits (set) by allaah, so do not approach them" (surah
~~al-baqarah 2:1871) "these are the limits set by allaah, so do not
~~transgress them" (surah al-baqarah 2:229) this is why islam does not
~~allow celibacy, because it is against the fitrah, i.e., the desire for
~~sex. celibacy goes beyond the limits required by humans, and is
~~something that cannot be fulfilled because humans are designed to
~~procreate. as humans we are not expected to fast every single day for
~~the rest of our lives (for most 30 days of the year provides an up-hill
~~struggle). it is also from ignorance to say that 'i shall not sleep
~~during the night, but rather i shall pray!' [3] humans have not been
~~created by allah to live life in such a manner. there is a balance which
~~must be observed. the following incident describes the islamic stance
~~towards such behaviour, anas reported that some of the companions of
~~allaah's messenger (saw) used to say: "i will not marry women"; someone
~~else said: "i will not eat meat"; and someone else said: "i will not lie
~~down in bed". (on hearing this): the prophet (saw) praised allaah, and
~~glorified him and said: "what has happened to these people that they say
~~so and so, whereas i observe prayer and i sleep too. i observe fast and
~~i break my fast; i marry women also. and he who turns away from my
~~sunnah (i.e. PageV02P0052
# , my example or lifestyle), he has no relation with me" [narrated in
~~saheeh muslim vol. 2. p703. no. 32361]. islam on the other hand, does
~~not allow the person to surrender themselves to lust and desire, as in
~~contemporary 'civilisation'. islam recognises the love a man has for
~~women, children, gold, silver, and other possessions. but it provides a
~~limit for the amount of this worldly pleasure which we require, and
~~reminds us of the life in the hereafter. "beautified for men is the love
~~of things they desire: women, children, much of gold and silver
~~(wealth), branded beautiful horses, cattle and well-tilled land. this is
~~the pleasure of the present world's life, but allaah has the excellent
~~return (paradise)" (surah aali-imraan 3:141) the inclinations and
~~desires of the fitrah are not to become the objective in life. rather
~~they are to be taken in a stabilised manner. the way to deal with them
~~is real and allaah (the most high) has given us the detailed
~~de******ions of a levelled approach. this levelled approach gives
~~mankind the perfectly balanced pleasure in this worldly life. the method
~~of maintaining a well-balanced life is not an endurance test to see who
~~lasts the longest. allah has revealed islam, to show us how to attain
~~this balance in a real manner. life is not a torturous spiritual test,
~~where you are ordered to iive in mountains and trees. fasting all year
~~round is not obligatory. PageV02P0053
# marriage is permissible and you do not have to beat yourself senseless
~~to purify your soul! rather as muslims, we must try to follow the
~~prophet and his balanced teachings of life and living. as allah says in
~~the qur'an: "indeed in the messenger of allah (saw), you have a good
~~example to follow.." (surah al-ahzab 33:21) restrictive rules the use of
~~the word "restrictive" often comes from those who think they live a
~~"free- life". but the fact of the matter is that, wherever you go you
~~will find rules and regulations. for example, in the workplace, in
~~colleges and universities and more obviously on the roads, i.e. the
~~highway and green cross codes. wherever you are, there are rules and
~~regulations. islam forbids us to follow many of the rules which are held
~~by western culture and subcultures. yet people in the west are more than
~~willing to obey them, because they believe that these rules will protect
~~them. how wrong they are! rave subculture is a classical example of
~~this. informal dance floor rules dictate to us ". . . . to drink lots of
~~water, have frequent breaks and don't take too many pills in one go!"
~~despite these "recommendations", young people are still dying [4].
~~western society is obsessed with 'safe sex', in order to 'prevent the
~~risk of catching aids'. despite the wide availability of contraceptives,
~~aids is still on the increase, and people are dropping like flies from
~~this killer epidemic. do we think of these rules as being restrictive?
~~if anything you would expect them to bring about a sense of control and
~~order, as well as increasing the pleasure. PageV02P0054
# without realising, people are ready and willing to accept many man-
~~made rules. rules that are invented by one group of people and to be
~~obeyed by the rest of society. these rules are not perfect because man
~~is imperfect, yet people accept them and hope and believe that they will
~~benefit from them. a better offer! so when the creator of the heavens
~~and the earth is offering a reward which is high, and the benefit is
~~eternal, shouldn't we at least see what's on offer? "you desire the good
~~of this world, but allaah desires (for you) the hereafter. and allaah is
~~almighty, all wise" (surah al-anfal 8:67) ". . . in a lofty paradise.
~~therein will be a running spring. therein will be thrones raised high.
~~and cups set at hand. and cushions set in rows. and rich carpets (all)
~~spread out" (surah al-ghaashiyah 88:10-16) this worldly life has many
~~good things in it. things that allah has created for us to utilise. but
~~the reality is all of these luxuries and benefits of the world will come
~~to an end. for example, a person's good looks may do them many favours
~~during their youth, but will it hold them on good ground when they are
~~60. such is the reality of old age. likewise with wealth. islam allows
~~you to gain wealth as long as you do not oppress other people, and
~~transgress the limits set by allaah (the most high). an example of this
~~is making people pay back more money than they actually borrow, through
~~usury or interest payments. however wealth can not benefit you when you
~~die, as it only passes on to your family as inheritance. PageV02P0055
# such is the civility of modem society, that many people are even
~~killed, just so that inheritance can be gained sooner rather then
~~later!! thus, we should see ourselves as travellers on a journey. a
~~traveller is one who is constantly on the move. he will only take
~~essential provisions, and not all his life's possessions. likewise, a
~~person must realise that allah did not design the luxuries of this world
~~to last forever. they only exist to aid our worship of allah, which will
~~take us to the journey's end, the hereafter. being human, we must one-
~~day die, and our worldly benefits and luxuries will also perish. the
~~true wealth is indeed with allah in the next-life. as allah says:
~~"seeking the perishable goods of the worldly life. there are much more
~~profits and booties with allah" (surah an-nisa 4:94) man-made
~~restrictions exist in all aspects of western society. industry, travel
~~and leisure, are just a few of the sectors which are dominated by human
~~restrictions. humans automatically assume that these restrictions are
~~there to protect them. in part this may be true, but what about the
~~restrictions set by allah which can save the whole of man-kind? such
~~restrictions come from the one who is perfect, and not man, who is
~~imperfect! the so-called 'freedom' of 'modern civilisation', is one
~~which is defined for you, by another human. we are often told what is
~~'politically correct' and what is not. we are told that this is what
~~everybody will be wearing this summer, and that this is the film to
~~watch. those are the new hollywood stars to emerge. PageV02P0056
# you shouldn't be seen 'dead' in this dress and you should paint your
~~finger-nails this colour. the list is endless. all of this is then
~~redefined to fit in with the next wave of fashion trends. those who do
~~not conform are labelled bigamist, narrow-minded, backward, out-dated
~~and so on. modern civilisation allows you so much freedom, that you can
~~even waiver the law if you are 'well connected'. laws are often defined
~~by a small group of people, with everyone else conforming to what they
~~consider right and wrong. what kind of justice is this? this would be
~~more acceptable to those who accept the concept of man being divine. a
~~concept where men decide what is moral and immoral even if it
~~contradicts what god has already laid out for us. god has no part to
~~play in such a civilisation, because man has adopted the role of god for
~~himself. history bears witness to this as it was the way of the
~~civilisations before the advent of the prophet muhammad (saw), as allah
~~says: "they (jews & christians) took their rabbis and their monks to be
~~their lords besides allah (by obeying them in things which they made
~~lawful or unlawful according to their own desires without being ordered
~~by allah)" (surah 9:31) the true freedom of man is found in a
~~civilisation that has a divine value system. a civilisation in which man
~~submits to his creator alone. a civilisation that reacts with the life
~~of this world and links it to the day of judgement. on that day,
~~everyone will be held accountable in front of allah, the creator and the
~~true master of the universe. PageV02P0057
# the purpose allaah created man and man belongs to him. allah decreed
~~that one day man shall die and return to him. the world is just a
~~temporary period. we are born, we live in this world and then we die. so
~~while we are on this earth allaah has given us the instruction manual to
~~shape our lives according to what he has decreed. this is the meaning of
~~worship. it requires absolute obedience, humility and love for allaah,
~~the way he has prescribed it. we cannot love allaah the way we want to,
~~especially if we do not know what allaah loves or hates in the first
~~place. so through allaah's perfect wisdom and infinite knowledge, he
~~sent us the qur'aan and the prophet muhammad (saw), and told us how this
~~love is to be expressed: "say (o muhammad (saw) to mankind): if you
~~really love allaah then follow me (i.e. the prophet (saw), and accept
~~that allaah is the one truly deserving of worship, follow the qur'an and
~~the sunnah). allaah will love you and forgive you your sins. and allaah
~~is most forgiving, most merciful" (surah aali-imraan 3:31) the problem
~~with human law humans by themselves cannot determine what is good and
~~bad for each other for all of the time. man-made laws are often defined
~~by a person's personal motives, emotions, limited intellect, beliefs and
~~prejudices. thus, they are designed with these built-in flaws. this is
~~why human law has so many loop-holes and deficiencies. PageV02P0058
# it is always requiring change, modification and re-modification, time
~~after time! so when allaah (the most high) revealed the qur'an and the
~~example of the prophet (saw), all the details about good and bad, or
~~right and wrong, were not left for the limited nature of mankind to
~~define for themselves. allaah (the most high) says: "and we have sent
~~down to you the book (qur'an) as an explanation of everything and a
~~guidance, a mercy and glad tidings for those who have surrendered (to
~~allaah as muslims)" (surah an-nahl 16:89) so what is islam saying? the
~~message of islam fits the fitrah of man. allaah (the most wise) created
~~man in the best form. he gave his fitrah the ability to believe in the
~~unseen. thus, man's soul and its horizons are broader and more open than
~~that of the rest of creation - like the animals, bird's and insects. in
~~nature we can see the signs of allah: "do they not look at the camels,
~~and how they were created? and at the heavens, how it is raised? and at
~~the mountains, how they are rooted and fixed firm? and at the earth, how
~~it is spread out?" (surah al-ghaashiyah 88:17-20) in ourselves we can
~~see allah's signs through the diversity of our languages, colours and
~~nationalities. PageV02P0059
# "o mankind! we have created you from a male and female, and have made
~~you into nations and tribes, that you may know one another" (surah al-
~~hujuraat 49:13) having been told this, we must now recognise the perfect
~~way our creator has chosen for us to follow, which is: "indeed, in the
~~messenger (muhammad [saw]), you have a good example to follow" (surah
~~al-ahzab 33:21) we have been commanded to worship allah alone without
~~partners. we must recognise and understand that he is the only true god
~~who deserves to be worshipped; "so know (muhammad [saw]), that none has
~~the right to be worshipped except allah" (surah muhammad 47:19) to help
~~us do this, allaah (the most high) sent the prophet muhammed (saw), to
~~deliver and explain the final message of islam, and to help us recognise
~~and worship our lord in the best manner. we have been told to form our
~~lives' according to this message, by following and imitating the final
~~messenger who is our only guide to worshipping our lord: allah. this is
~~what is meant when we say: laa-illaa-ha il-allaah, wa muhammadur rasool-
~~allah. "there is no true god worthy of worship except allaah, and
~~muhammad is the final messenger of allaah" footnotes [1] this can be
~~explained as, the inborn or innate nature of mankind to recognise the
~~truth about the creator [allah]; that he is the only one who truly and
~~sincerely deserves to be worshipped. [2] sallallahu alayhi wassallam,
~~i.e. the peace and blessings of allah be upon him (the prophet). we as
~~muslims have been commanded to say this every time the prophet's name is
~~mentioned. PageV02P0060
# this is done as a mark of respect and the honour which he deserves.
~~[3] this is not to say that prayer at night is not important, but if you
~~don't get enough sleep how are you going to fulfil your other
~~obligations, e.g. going to work in order to provide for your family. the
~~times of praying at night have been explained by the prophet (saw) as
~~being in the last 3rd of the night before the fajr prayer. [4] the death
~~of the teenager leah betts a few years ago [in england], has shown how

~~مفهوم الرسالة في الإسلام risalah (the message) PageV02P0061
# risalah (the message) the word risalah is defined as 'message'. but
~~here we use it for the whole process of god's chosen messengers coming
~~forth, one after another, under allah's divine guidance. from the
~~beginning of mankind, prophets have come to their respective peoples.
~~their mission was to exhort them to worship none but allah and to lead a
~~life of virtue. the first man adam (pbuh) was a prophet, as were
~~abraham, david, moses and jesus (peace be upon them all). we read in the
~~islamic tradition that over a hundred thousand prophets have preached
~~the religion of god here. the holy qur'an says that there has never been
~~a people to whom a prophet has not come and that all those prophets
~~taught their people the same message. the essence of that message is:
~~worship allah alone and do good. the distinction of muhammad (pbuh)
~~among these prophets is simply that he was the last prophet, through
~~whom the divine guidance was completed and perfected. one important
~~point for muslims to remember is that they should respect all the
~~prophets of god alike; that they should not discriminate between god's
~~prophets. in the holy qur'an, allah says to prophet muhammad (pbuh):
~~"nothing is said to you that was not said to the messengers before you
~~... " (41: 43). this means that all the prophets preached basically the
~~same religion. this fact underscores the idea of the continuity of the
~~divine message. PageV02P0062
# hence it is evident that islam is not a new religion, but it is the
~~religion of abraham, moses, jesus and all the prophets who came to all
~~the peoples of the world at several stages in human history. but at the
~~same time, it should be emphasized here that islam, as taught by
~~muhammad, is its latest and most complete form of the message. for this
~~reason, we have to study and follow it from the model life of the last
~~prophet, muhammad (pbuh). it is also worthy of note that the events and
~~incidents in the life of muhammad (pbuh) have been so faithfully
~~recorded by his companions in such detail that there is no other life
~~that can bear comparison to it. this is important because muslims must
~~be able to get the guidelines they require from the life of the prophet.
~~by the declaration of the second part of the muslim shahada (witness),
~~which is "ash-hadu anna muhammad rasool allah" (muhammad is the
~~messenger of allah), a muslim vows to accept muhammad (pbuh) as his role
~~model in life. if the qur'an is the word of god, the model life led by
~~muhammad is its practical expression. that means a muslim has to
~~actualize the commands and prohibitions of god given in the qur'an by
~~following in all the areas of life, allah's messenger, muhammad (pbuh).

~~عواقب المعصية impact & effect of sins PageV02P0063
# impact & effect of sins when allah commands us to give up sins and to
~~avoid them it is not because our sins will harm him. it is only us who
~~will benefit by avoiding sins. likewise, we alone will be affected by
~~the sins we commit. it was the habit of the righteous ancestors to think
~~about their sins whenever they were faced with hardship in anything. in
~~fact, sins have many bad effects on the lives of the sinners. how can
~~sins change our lives? what are the effects of sins on our well-being?
~~imam ibn al-qayyim al-jawziyah explains to us these effects in his well-
~~known book al-jawab al-kafi: prevention of knowledge: knowledge is a
~~light which allah throws into the heart and disobedience extinguishes
~~this light. imam ash-shafi`i said: “i complained to wakee` about the
~~weakness of my memory, so he ordered me to abandon disobedience and
~~informed me that knowledge is light. he said that the light of allah is
~~not given to the disobedient.” prevention of sustenance: just as
~~righteousness brings about sustenance, the abandonment of righteousness
~~causes poverty. there is nothing which can bring about sustenance like
~~the abandonment of sins. prevention of obedience (to allah): if there
~~was no other punishment for sin except that it prevents one from obeying
~~allah then this would be sufficient. disobedience weakens the heart and
~~the body: the fact that it weakens the heart is clear. disobedience
~~continues to weaken the heart until its life ceases completely.
~~PageV02P0064
# disobedience reduces one's lifespan and destroys any blessings: just
~~as righteousness increases one’s lifespan, sinning reduces it. legacy of
~~the cursed: every type of disobedience is the legacy of a nation from
~~among those which allah destroyed. sodomy is a legacy of the people of
~~lot, taking more than one's due right and giving what is less is a
~~legacy of the people of shu`aib, spreading mischief and corruption is a
~~legacy of the people of pharaoh and pride, including arrogance and
~~tyranny, is a legacy of the people of hud. so the disobedient one is
~~somehow a part of those nations who were the enemies of allah.
~~disobedience is a cause of the servant being held in contempt by his
~~lord: al-hasan al-basri said: “they became contemptible in (his sight)
~~so they disobeyed him. if they were honorable (in his sight) he would
~~have protected them.” effect of sins on others: the ill-effects of the
~~sinner fall upon those around him as well as the animals as a result of
~~which they are touched by harm. living in sin: the servant continues to
~~commit sins until they become very easy for him and seem insignificant
~~in his heart and this is a sure sign of destruction. every time a sin
~~becomes insignificant in the sight of the servant it becomes great in
~~the sight of allah. disobedience brings humiliation and lowliness: every
~~aspect of honor lies in the obedience of allah. ibn al-mubarak said: “i
~~have seen sins kill the hearts. and humiliation is inherited by their
~~continuity. the abandonment of sins gives life to the hearts. and the
~~prevention of your soul is better for it. PageV02P0065
# ” disobedience corrupts the intellect: the intellect has light and
~~disobedience extinguishes this light. when the light of the intellect is
~~extinguished it becomes weak and deficient. sealing of the heart: when
~~disobedience increases, the servant’s heart becomes sealed so that he
~~becomes of those who are heedless. the exalted said: [but no! a stain
~~has been left on their hearts on account of what they used to earn (that
~~is, their actions)] (al-mutaffifin 83: 14). sins cause various types of
~~corruption to occur in the land: corruption of the water, the air, the
~~plants, the fruit, and the dwelling places. the exalted said: [mischief
~~has appeared on the land and the sea on account of what the hands of men
~~have earned; that he may give them a taste of some of (the actions) they
~~have done, in order that they may return] (ar-rum 30: 41). disappearance
~~of modesty: modesty is the essence of the life of the heart and is the
~~basis of every good. its disappearance is the disappearance of all that
~~is good. the prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said: “modesty is
~~goodness, all of it.” sins weaken and reduce the magnification of allah
~~the almighty in the heart of the servant. sins are the cause of allah
~~forgetting his servant: sinning also causes allah to abandon him and
~~leave him to fend for himself with his soul and his satan and in this is
~~destruction from which no deliverance can be hoped for. being removed
~~from the realm of benevolence: when a persons sins, benevolence is
~~removed from his heart. when benevolence fills the heart it prevents it
~~from disobedience. PageV02P0066
# disobedience causes the favors (of allah) to cease and makes his
~~revenge lawful: no blessing ceases to reach a servant except because of
~~a sin, and no retribution is made lawful upon him except because of a
~~sin. ali ibn abi talib (may allah be pleased with him) said: “no trial
~~has descended except due to a sin and it (the trial) is not repelled
~~except by repentance.” source http://www.islamonline.net/english/onthepa
~~thofreturn/articles/12-2004/03.shtml باب التوبة مفتوح the door of
~~repentance is wide open PageV02P0067
# the door of repentance is wide open by sheikh ahmad kutty it is never
~~too late for a true muslim to repent to allah, and to shed tears for the
~~wrong doing he has committed, keeping in mind that if one manages to
~~escape the punishment of mortals, he will not for sure escape the
~~punishment of allah in the hereafter. so, it is better to start a new
~~leaf and let bygones be bygones. as long as you are sincere in your
~~repentance, allah almighty will accept your repentance and forgive you
~~your sins. if you committed evil but have repented sincerely, and
~~changed your life around for better, then allah has certainly promised
~~to grant you mercy and forgiveness. it is one of the basic principles of
~~belief in islam that allah is all-relenting, all-forgiving and all-
~~merciful. here are a few verses which clearly convey this crucial
~~concept: [do they not know that it is allah who accepts the repentance
~~of his servants and receives (approves) their charity, and that allah is
~~the relenting, the compassionate?] (at-tawbah 9: 104) [say: ‘o my
~~servants who wronged against their souls, do not despair of allah’s
~~mercy! for allah forgives all sins; for he is indeed forgiving,
~~compassionate.] (az-zumar 39: 53) so do not put off repentance; take the
~~necessary steps immediately, for no one can tell when the death will
~~overtake us. the door of repentance is open so long as we are not in the
~~throes of death, for the prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said,
~~“allah accepts the repentance of his servant so long as death has not
~~reached his collar bone. PageV02P0068
# ” but since we have no way of knowing when death will overtake us, we
~~must never be complacent or slack in hastening to taking steps towards
~~repentance. while speaking of repentance, we must rush to add, that it
~~cannot be considered as valid unless one takes the following steps: one
~~must feel deep remorse for the sins one has committed. one must refrain
~~from it totally while also abstaining from all those leads or
~~circumstances that led him to such a sin in the first place. he must be
~~firmly resolved never to sin again, and immediately becoming occupied in
~~whatever good deeds that he can in order to wipe out his past sins. all
~~of the above involve sins involving the rights of allah; if, however,
~~your sins involve the rights of human beings, then you must also do
~~whatever it takes to return or compensate or redress the grievances of
~~the person you have wronged. paying him his dues or compensating him in
~~whatever ways possible becomes an essential condition of valid
~~repentance. repentance, as stated above once accomplished, will
~~undoubtedly wipe out one’s sins, and guarantee him a clean record. the
~~prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) said, “one who has repented of
~~a sin (sincerely) is like one who has never sinned at all.” in
~~conclusion, after sinning, one should not feel despair. rather one
~~should forward sincere repentance to allah and rest assured that allah
~~almighty will forgive his sin, as long as his repentance meets the
~~abovementioned conditions of sincerity. PageV02P0069
# moreover, you must learn how to forget, for the more you look back to
~~your old days of sinful habit, the wider the door is open for satan to
~~draw you back. scholars used to resemble this case to that of gazelle
~~being chased by hound. despite that gazelle is naturally faster in
~~speed, but its frequent looking back weakens its morale and makes it an
~~easy prey for hounds. source http://www.islamonline.net/english/onthepat
~~hofreturn/articles/12-2004/01.shtml أهمية الوقت في الإسلام the
~~importance of time in islam PageV02P0070
# the importance of time in islam in general, sensible people know the
~~importance of time. there are among those who believe in the popular
~~saying as “time is gold.” time in islam is more than gold or any
~~precious material thing in this world. of all religions, only islam
~~guides mankind not only to the importance of time but also how to value
~~it. allah the almighty and his messenger, prophet mohammad (pbuh), very
~~clearly tell us the value of time, why we must not waste it and how we
~~can make use of our time wisely to increase our eeman (faith) and thus
~~attain success, especially eternal success in the life hereafter. both
~~the qur’an and the sunnah enjoin muslims to be conscious of time. we are
~~reminded that life in this world is nothing but temporary. we never know
~~when death has been appointed for us. we must value time for the
~~satisfaction of allah the almighty. for our guidance and success, we
~~must never waste time nor abuse it. bin ‘abbas narrated that prophet
~~mohammad (pbuh) said: “there are two blessings which many people lose:
~~(they are) health and free time for doing good.” (bukhari 8/421) indeed,
~~we displease allah the most high when we abuse time. we must remember
~~that time must be spent to fulfill our very purpose in life ¾ that is to
~~worship allah all throughout our lives. allah makes this very clear in
~~the qur’an when he says: “i have created not the jinn and men except
~~that they should worship me (alone). i seek not any provision from them
~~nor do i ask that they should feed me. verily, allah is the all-
~~provider, owner of power, most strong. PageV02P0071
# ” qur’an (51:56-58) “so glorify the praises of your rabb (only god and
~~sustainer) and be of those who prostrate themselves (to him). and
~~worship your rabb until there comes unto you the hour that is certain
~~(i.e., death).” (qur'an 15:98-99) everything we do in accordance with
~~the qur’an and the sunnah is an act of worship. such worship must be
~~done sincerely for the pleasure of allah alone. we should make use of
~~our time (which includes our “free time”) in doing beneficial things
~~especially those that will make us closer to allah and earn his mercy.
~~we have to make use of our time wisely by knowing more of the qur’an and
~~the sunnah. we must have correct knowledge of what allah and his
~~messenger have commanded us to do and at the same time to refrain from
~~what they have forbidden us. this is imperative so that we earn allah’s
~~pleasure and reward. allah the exalted makes it very clear, when he
~~says: “o you who believe! obey allah, and obey the messenger (mohammad)
~~and render not vain your deeds. PageV02P0072
# ” (qur'an 47:33) corollary to the above divine commandment, we must
~~ask ourselves: have we been obeying allah and his messenger? to what
~~extent have we used our time learning the qur’an and the sunnah in order
~~to have correct eeman (faith), to do righteous deeds, to enjoin the
~~truth or do da’wah, and be patient and constant? as time passes by, are
~~we sure we are devoting our time for the sincere worship and pleasure of
~~allah the most high? are we taking guidance from the following very
~~enlightening ayat (qur’anic verses)? “by the time, verily man is in
~~loss, except such as have faith, and do righteous deeds, and join
~~(together) in the mutual enjoining of truth, and of patience and
~~constancy.” qur’an (103:1-3) in line with the above qur’anic injunction,
~~we have to discipline ourselves by giving value to the importance of
~~time. we must be prompt in doing good deeds, which will increase our
~~faith and subsequently enable us to gain allah’s pleasure and mercy. we
~~have to remember that on the day of judgement we shall be asked how we
~~spent our lives, wealth and knowledge. in other words, we will be
~~questioned on how we spent everything that allah has given us as implied
~~in the following hadith: narrated abdullah bin mas`ud allah’s messenger
~~(pbuh) said: “a man shall be asked concerning five things on the day of
~~resurrection: concerning his life, how he spent it; concerning his
~~youth, how he grew old; concerning his wealth, whence he acquired it,
~~and in what way he spent it; and what was it that he did with the
~~knowledge that he had. PageV02P0073
# ” abu barzah nadlah ibn ubayd al-aslami narrated that the
~~prophet(pbuh) said: “a servant of allah will remain standing on the day
~~of judgment till he is questioned: about his age and how he spent it;
~~and about his knowledge and how he utilized it; about his wealth from
~~where he acquired it and in what (activities) he spent it; and about his
~~body as to how he used it.” if we are to evaluate ourselves objectively,
~~have we been spending our time wisely for the pleasure of allah the
~~almighty? have we been spending our lives based on the qur’an and the
~~sunnah? have we been practicing muslims? how many of us are muminoon
~~(faithful muslims) and/or mutaqqoon (god-fearing muslims)? how much
~~knowledge of the qur’an and the sunnah do we know? do we practice what
~~we learn and impart the same to others or at least share them to our
~~families and kin? have we ever enjoined to others what is right and
~~forbid what is wrong? to be successful, we have to manage our time
~~wisely by making plans for virtuous deeds that please allah the
~~almighty. we must spend time learning islam (based on the qur’an and the
~~sunnah and the right deductions from these two revealed ures). source

~~bin/news_service/spot_full_story.asp?service_id=763 معنى التوحيد tawhid
~~or belief in one god PageV02P0074
# tawhid or belief in one god the basis of islam is the belief in the
~~one god, who is the creator and sustainer of the whole universe and
~~everything in it. the first part of the shahadah, (witnessing to the
~~fundamental doctrine of islam) is la ilaha illallah. it means: there is
~~no one worthy of worship except allah. this simple statement implies the
~~following ideas: · allah, the creator of the whole universe is one. ·
~~humanity is one, as all the human beings are created equal. · the
~~religion is one, as all the prophets taught the same god-given religion.
~~there is an underlying unity in the diverse phenomena of the universe,
~~which is borne out by the uniformity of laws that govern the working of
~~every part of the universe. we do not see any clash in the so-called
~~laws of nature, which are also called the laws of science, as scientists
~~have discovered them. this is a fact that very clearly points to the
~~unity of the lawgiver, allah. human beings, whether black, white, brown,
~~asian, australian or european show the same qualities that characterize
~~the species called homosapiens (man the wise). this means that
~~differences of nationality, race or language are accidental and have no
~~innate value. as dryden, the famous english essayist wrote, "mankind is
~~ever the same." this unity of mankind is linked to the unity of the
~~creator, from the islamic point of view. from the very beginning of
~~mankind, god has revealed through his prophets answers to man's eternal
~~questions. PageV02P0075
# to different peoples of the world who lived in different periods of
~~history, god sent his guidance through his prophets. and it was thus
~~that religion came into existence. though taught by different prophets,
~~the essential religion of god had to be the same since the source of
~~this guidance was the same and the addressees were basically also the
~~same. hence the unity of religion. since the life of a muslim is to be
~~completely god-directed, he/she has to accept the following ideas about
~~god: allah is the one god, who has no partner; there is nothing and no
~~one like him. he is the first, the last, and the everlasting; he is all-
~~powerful, eternally just, the supreme, the sovereign. he is the all-
~~knowing, and all-merciful, and he is the only one capable of granting
~~life to anything. for the above reasons, accept his guidance alone,
~~worship him alone and seek his help alone. allah says in the holy
~~qur'an: "he knows what is in land and sea; not a leaf falls, but he
~~knows it. not a grain in the earth's shadow, not a thing fresh or
~~withered, but it is in a book manifest. it is he who recalls you by
~~night, and he knows what you work by day" (an'am, 6: 59-60). also:
~~"there is no god but he, the living, the everlasting. slumber seizes him
~~not, neither sleep; to him belongs all that is in the heavens and the
~~earth. who is there that shall intercede with him save by his leave? he
~~knows what lies before them and what is after them, and they comprehend
~~not anything of his knowledge save such as he wills. PageV02P0076
# his throne comprises the heavens and earth; the preserving of them
~~oppresses him not; he is the all-high, the all-glorious" (baqara, 2:
~~255) so what should be our duty to god? allah says: "o you men, serve
~~your lord who created you, and those that were before you; so that you
~~will be god-fearing; who assigned to you the earth for a couch, and
~~heaven for an edifice, and sent down out of heaven water, wherewith he
~~brought forth fruits for your provision; so set not up rivals to god
~~wittingly" (al-baqara, 2: 21-22). thus, a muslim has to surrender his/
~~her self to allah, the only creator and preserver - who alone deserves
~~our whole-hearted worship and unconditional obedience. source

~~(الجزء الأول) thanking allah part one PageV02P0077
# thanking allah:part one praising allah (hamd) has a more general and
~~inclusive meaning than thanking or gratitude (shukr), for thanks and
~~gratitude are only a repay for a favour, whereas hamd is both a
~~recompense like thanks and spontaneous praise. if you understand the
~~universal nature of hamd you will know that your saying "al-hamdu
~~lillah" (praise be to allah) requires praise of him for his majesty,
~~vastness, unity, might, bestowal of favors, knowledge, ability and
~~power, wisdom and other attributes, and that it includes the meanings of
~~his ninety-nine beautiful names. what a word [it is] which gathers
~~together that which volumes find difficult to express. in islamic
~~terminology, thankfulness is the acknowledgment of the fact that allah
~~is the only grantor of graces, and full submission to allah in a way
~~that assures that acknowledgment. the graces (favors) of allah are
~~endless and countless. allah says: "and if you were to count the
~~blessings of allah, you will never be able to count them." qur'an (14:
~~34) he, the all mighty also says: "and whatever blessings and good you
~~have, it is from allah ..." qur'an (16: 53) thanks with the tongue is
~~praise of the bestower of blessings and speaking about the blessings.
~~prophet mohammad (pbuh), said: "to talk about blessings is gratitude."
~~thanks expressed by the limbs means to act in obedience to allah and to
~~abandon disobedience to him. a thanks with the heart is recognition of
~~the extent of the blessing and the knowledge that it is a gracious
~~bestowal and not from the slave's own merit. PageV02P0078
# know that the blessings which require gratitude cannot be enumerated,
~~but they can be expressed in terms of three categories: 1- worldly
~~blessings such as health and wealth; 2- blessings of the religion such
~~as knowledge and fear and respect to allah 3- other-wordly blessings,
~~which are one's being recompensed with much reward for few actions in a
~~short life. how can one thank allah? the word 'worshipers' represents
~~mankind, for all of mankind should totally submit to the will of allah-
~~we can thank allah in many ways. among these ways: 1. prostrating to
~~allah: if you receive a blessing from allah or when allah save you from
~~a disaster. prophet mohammad (pbuh) used to prostrate to allah whenever
~~he received a pleasant thing or was told good news. this prostration is
~~conducted for the sole purpose of giving thanks to allah, the granter of
~~the grace and benefit that the servant received. abdur-rahman ibn 'auf
~~narrates that prophet mohammad (pbuh) went out once and he followed him
~~until he entered a grove of palm trees and prostrated. his prostration
~~was so long that 'abdur-rahman feared that allah had taken his soul.
~~'abdur-rahman came to look at him and he raised his head and said: "what
~~is wrong, abdur-rahman'?" abdur rahman mentioned what had happened, and
~~he (pbuh) said: "gibra'el came to me and said: 'shall i not give you
~~glad tidings'? allah says to you, whoever prays upon you, i pray upon
~~him. whoever salutes you, i salute him.' therefore, i prostrated to
~~allah in thanks." 2. PageV02P0079
# thanking allah in words: the majority of muslim scholars agreed that
~~if one does not thank allah for the grace he has, then that grace will
~~be taken away from him and may never come back. prophet mohammad (pbuh)
~~said: "it is a fine thing when a believer praises and thanks allah if
~~good comes to him, and praises allah and shows endurance if smitten by
~~affliction. the believer is rewarded for everything, even for the morsel
~~he raises to his wife's mouth." 3. talking about the benefits allah has
~~granted to you. this is because hiding and denying the benefits of allah
~~is being ungrateful. allaah says in the qur'an: "do they believe in the
~~false deities and deny the favor of allaah."qur'an (16:72) narrated by
~~zaid bin khalid al juhani: the prophet (pbuh) led us in the fajr prayer
~~at hudaibiya after a rainy night. on completion of the prayer, he faced
~~the people and said: "do you know what your lord has said (revealed)?"
~~the people replied, "allah and his messenger know better." he said,
~~"allah has said, 'in this morning some of my slaves remained as true
~~believers and some became non-believers; whoever said that the rain was
~~due to the blessings and the mercy of allah had belief in me and he
~~disbelieves in the stars, and whoever said that it rained because of a
~~particular star had no belief in me but believes in that star." 4.
~~helping people in need: it was mentioned in a hadith of prophet mohammad
~~(pbuh) that: "as the grants from allah to a servant increase so will the
~~people's needs of that blessed servant's services. PageV02P0080
# if the servant ignores their needs, it will cause those grants to be
~~removed" prophet mohammad (pbuh) said: "if anyone strokes an orphan's
~~head, doing so only for allah's sake, he will have blessings for every
~~hair over which his hand passes; and if anyone treats well an orphan
~~girl or boy under his care, he and i shall be like these two in
~~paradise," putting two of his fingers together." source

~~الثاني) thanking allah part two PageV02P0081
# thanking allah: part two you may find someone who doesn't thank allah;
~~this is related to several factors: 1- the servant may be unaware of the
~~general grants that were bestowed by allah on the creatures. many people
~~wrongly think that money is the only thing to be considered and ignore
~~the other general grants such as hearing, vision, sanity and health.
~~prophet mohammad (pbuh) said: "there are two blessings which many people
~~lose: (they are) health and free time for doing good." aicha, the
~~prophet's wife said: "whenever a servant drinks a drop of water which
~~gets into his body and leaves it with no harm, then thanks is due." a
~~man came to a good muslim and complained that allah made him very poor.
~~the good man said: "would you like to have ten thousand dinars and be
~~insane?" the complainer answered: "no." the good man said: "would you
~~like to have ten thousand dinars but have your legs chopped off" the
~~complainer answered: "no." the good man then said: "aren't you ashamed
~~of yourself complaining about your lord while all of these grants which
~~are his; have been bestowed on you?" 2. the servant may not give thanks
~~to allah because he is unaware of the people who have fewer bounties
~~than him. prophet mohammad (pbuh) said: "look at those people who have
~~less than you and never look at those who have more grants than you,
~~this will ensure that you will not depreciate allah's grants." at times
~~of hardship, one should look at those who own less worldly things than
~~him and thus thank allah. he will then be calmed and his ungratefulness
~~will disappear. PageV02P0082
# one will then thank his lord and say: "thanks to allah who has guarded
~~me against the harm which he has afflicted others, and who has chosen
~~not to afflict me" 3- the servant may not give thanks to his lord
~~because he doesn't understand the meanings of allah's names, attributes
~~and laws. the real ignorant person is the one who gets deceived by the
~~amount of money he has or by his position or his power. he forgets the
~~fact that as allah has granted, and that he also is totally capable of
~~taking those blessings away. allah says: "say, o allah! lord of power
~~(and rule) you give power to whom you will and you take away power from
~~whom you will, and you endue with honor whom you will, and humiliate who
~~you will. in your hand is the good. verily, you are able to do all
~~things." qur'an (3:26) when does allah take his grants away from his
~~servants? 1- when one commits sins: prophet mohammad (pbuh) said: "the
~~servant will be deprived a provision because he committed a sin" on the
~~other hand, fearing allah causes his provisions to come forth, allah
~~says in the qur'an: "and whoever fears allaah and keeps his duty to him,
~~allah will make way for him out of every difficulty, and he will provide
~~for him from sources he never imagined" qur'an (65:2-3) 2- when one
~~relates the grants to himself and does not acknowledge that allah is
~~their grantor as qaroon (a tyrannical king mentioned in the qur'an al-
~~qasas (28): 78) said: allah says in the qur'an: "this has been given to
~~me only because of knowledge i possess." consequently. PageV02P0083
# his punishment was, "so we caused the earth to swallow him and his
~~dwelling place. then he had no group or party to help him against
~~allah." qur'an (28: 81) 3- when the servant does not pay the zakat.
~~prophet mohammad (pbuh) said: "indeed allah the most high said, 'we have
~~sent down the wealth for the prayer to be established and that zakat be
~~given; and if the son of adam had a valley, he would love to have a
~~second; if he had two valleys, he would love to have a third ... " so
~~the money is actually allah's money, and we have been entrusted with it.
~~and prophet mohammad (pbuh) said: "do not shut your money bag; otherwise
~~allah too will withhold his blessings from you. spend (in allah's cause)
~~as much as you can afford. " the prophet of allah (pbuh) also said: "do
~~not withhold your money by counting it (i.e. hoarding it), (for if you
~~did so), allah would also withhold his blessings from you." 4- if one
~~becomes arrogant due to the large amount of money he has. if the person
~~feels superior to other people, and becomes obsessed with his wealth, if
~~he talks about it and only about it wherever he goes, and forgets to
~~remember allah and praise him; if he starts evaluating people based on
~~their wealth, then allah will take away his grants. allah says: "woe to
~~every slanderer and back biter. who has gathered wealth and counted it.
~~he thinks that his wealth will make last forever. nay! verily, he will
~~be thrown into the crushing fire. PageV02P0084
# " qur'an (104:1-4) and finally there is no better example for us than
~~the messenger of allah (pbuh) who used to offer night prayers till his
~~feet became swollen. and when told: "allah has forgiven you, your faults
~~of the past and those to follow." on that, he said, "shouldn't i be a
~~thankful worshiper?!" source http://www.islamonline.com/cgi-

~~الأول) supplication in islam (du'a) part one PageV02P0085
# supplication in islam (du'a):part one in addition to formal prayers,
~~muslims "call upon" god throughout the day. in the qur'an, allah says:
~~"when my servants ask about me, i am indeed close to them. i listen to
~~the prayer of every supplicant, when he calls on me. let them also, with
~~a will, listen to my call, and believe in me, so that they may walk in
~~the right way" qur'an (2:186). this is an extract from “supplication”,
~~written by abdulaziz addarweesh in the name of allah, the most
~~beneficent, the most merciful. the subject of supplication is very
~~important. every muslim must know how to supplicate the way that allah
~~has directed us. i found it very important to write about this subject
~~to guide our brothers in islam to perform this kind of worship the
~~correct way. i also ask allah (swt) to guide me to do good deeds and may
~~peace and blessings be upon the prophet, his family, companions and all
~~of his followers to the day of judgment. proofs of supplication from
~~qur’an all mighty allah (swt) said : “and when my slaves ask you (o
~~mohammed) concerning me then (answer them), i am indeed near (to them by
~~my knowledge). i respond to the invocations of the supplicant when he
~~calls on me (without any mediator or intercessor). so let them obey me
~~and believe in me, so that they may be led to the right path.” (qur'an
~~2:186). prophet mohammad (pbuh) was asked by some of his companions; "is
~~allah near so we invoke him or is he far so we call him? so allah
~~revealed this verse. PageV02P0086
# allah is near he can hear the supplicant anytime anywhere and respond
~~to him if the supplicant invokes allah (swt) with a sincere heart and
~~avoid interdictions of supplication. allah also said: “invoke your lord
~~with humility and in secret, he likes not the aggressors." (qur'an 7:55)
~~supplication is of two kinds. one is worship and the other is a request.
~~so he commands to be invoked with humility which is insisting in request
~~and continuously in worship and “secretly" not loud to avoid "ryea"
~~(showing off). allah (swt) also said: “and your lord said: -invoke me
~~[i.e. believe in my oneness] (and ask me for anything) i will respond to
~~your (invocation). verily! those who scorn my worship [i.e. do not
~~invoke me, and do not believe in my oneness ] they will surely enter
~~hell in humiliation!” (qur'an 40:60). allah (swt) said: “invoke me, i
~~will respond to you”, so from his mercy for his slaves he has promised
~~to respond to their invocations but for those who do not invoke him, he
~~has promised punishment because invocation of allah (swt) is an act of
~~worship and refusing to invoke him ( disbelieving in him or having doubt
~~in his ability to answer the invocation) is refusal to worship him.
~~proofs of supplication from sunnah narrated an-numan bin bashir (may
~~allah be pleased with him): the prophet (pbuh) said: "verily,
~~supplication is worship”. [reported by ai-arbaa (the four) and ai-
~~tirmidhi, graded it sahih (sound)]. narrated anas (may allah be pleased
~~with him): the prophet (pbuh) said: “supplication is the pith (essence)
~~of worship”. PageV02P0087
# [reported by at-tirmidhi with a full chain of narrators]. narrated abu
~~hurayrah (ra): the prophet (saw) said: “nothing is more honorable (most
~~liked ) before allah (swt) than supplication “. [reported by at-
~~tirmidhi, ibn hibban and al-hakim graded it sahih]. from all the,
~~hadiths above we see that supplication is a type of worship and it is
~~honorable to allah or liked by allah (swt). manners of supplication *
~~supplication should start with, "in the name of allah, praise is to
~~allah, and peace and blessings be upon the messenger of allah and should
~~end with (peace and blessing be upon the messenger of allah)". *
~~supplication should be performed secretly and with a present (sincere)
~~heart. allah (swt) said: "invoke your lord with humility and in secret,
~~he likes not the aggressors". (qur'an 7:55) * supplicate allah (swt)
~~with humility and express your need of allah (swt). he said: "verily,
~~they used to hasten on to do good deeds, and they used to call on us
~~with hope and fear, and used to humble themselves before us" qur'an
~~(21:90) * insist to allah (swt) in your supplication by repeating it
~~many times. * invoke allah (swt) by his names and attributes. he said:
~~"and (all) the most beautiful names belong to allah, so call on him by
~~them" qur'an (7:180). * supplicate allah (swt) by mentioning the
~~righteous deeds you have done. narrated abdullah bin umar (may allah be
~~pleased with him), that he heard allah's messenger (pbuh), saying "three
~~men, amongst those who became before you set out until night came and
~~they reached a cave, so they entered it. PageV02P0088
# a rock slithered down from a mountain and blocked the entrance of the
~~cave. they said: “nothing will save you from this except that you
~~supplicate to allah (swt) by mentioning the righteous deeds you have
~~done etc." [reported by bukhari and muslim]. * admit your sins during
~~your supplication. allah (swt) said: "dhan-nun (jonah), when he went off
~~in anger, and imagined that we shall not punish him. but he cried
~~through the darkness (saying)" "la ilaha illa anta (none has the ,right
~~to be worshiped but you) glorified be you, truly, i have been of the
~~wrongdoers" (qur'an 21:87). * repeat each sentence of your supplication
~~three times. from the long hadith narrated by ibn masaud (may allah be
~~pleased with him), and when the prophet (pbuh) finished his salat, he
~~raised his voice and supplicated on them and when he supplicated, he
~~supplicated three times...." [reported by muslim]. * face the kiblah
~~(mecca) during your supplication. narrated abdullah bin zaid (may allah
~~be pleased with him); allah's messenger (pbuh) went out to his praying
~~place to offer the salat of istisqa (rain). he invoked allah (pbuh) for
~~rain and then faced al-kiblah and turned his upper garment inside out.
~~[reported by bukhari]. * raise your hands while supplicating allah
~~(swt). as in the hadith of abu musa (may allah be pleased with him);
~~when the prophet (pbuh) had finished from the battle of hunain, he said:
~~"the prophet (pbuh) asked for water, performed ablution and then raised
~~his hands saying 'o allah forgive ubaid abi amir.” [reported by bukahri
~~and muslim]. PageV02P0089
# * be in the state of purity during your supplication. * when making
~~supplication for others, start with yourself first then include others.
~~allah (swt) said about noah (pbuh) "my lord, forgive me and my parents
~~and him who enters my home as a believer, and all the believing men and
~~women.." (qur'an 71:28). * do not be aggressive when you are
~~supplicating allah (swt) such as asking him to make you a prophet and
~~you know there will not be a prophet after mohammed (pbuh) or make you
~~live for ever and you know every one will die. * remember to include
~~your parents in your supplication. * be patient. do not expect an
~~immediate response from allah (swt) although this could happen. but if
~~it does not, then you should be patient and continue supplicating allah
~~(swt) until you see the results. narrated abu hurayrah (may allah be
~~pleased with him); prophet mohammad (pbuh) said: "the invocation of
~~anyone of you is responded to by allah (swt) if he does not show
~~impatience by saying; 'i invoked allah (swt) but my request has not been
~~granted” . [reported by bukhari and muslim]. middle east advertising by

# supplication in islam (du'a):part two in addition to formal prayers,
~~muslims "call upon" god throughout the day. times of supplication there
~~are certain times when supplication is more likely to be accepted by
~~allah (swt) as the prophet (pbuh) said. these times are: the last third
~~of the night: narrated abu hurayrah (may allah be pleased with him);
~~that prophet mohammad (pbuh)said: in the last third of every night our
~~lord (allah [swt]) descends to the lowermost heaven and says; “who is
~~calling me, so that i may answer him? who is asking me so that may i
~~grant him? who is seeking forgiveness from me so that i may forgive
~~him?". [reported by bukahri]. late at night, when people are sleeping
~~and busy with worldly pleasures allah (swt) gives the believers an
~~opportunity, or an answer hour if they can fight sleep and invoke allah
~~(swt) for whatever they need. between adhan and iqama: narrated anas
~~(ra); allah's messenger (pbuh) said: a supplication made between the
~~adhan (calling for prayer) and (calling to start praying) iqama is not
~~rejected. [reported by an-nasai and ibn hibban graded it sahihan hour on
~~friday: narrated abu hurayrah (may allah be pleased with him); allah's
~~messenger (pbuh) talked about friday and said: "there is an hour on
~~friday and if a muslim gets it while offering salat (prayer) and asks
~~something from allah (swt), then allah (swt) will definitely meet his
~~demand". and he (the prophet (pbuh) pointed out the shortness of that
~~time with his hands. [reported by bukahri]. PageV02P0092
# some said this hour is from the time the imam (prayer's leader) enters
~~the mosque on friday's prayer until the prayer is over where others have
~~said that it is the last hour of the day. (note: when we say an hour
~~here we do not mean the hour everyone knows [60 minutes] but an
~~unspecified period of time because the time counters which we use today
~~came after the prophet (pbuh) had died. while drinking zamzam water:
~~narrated jaber (may allah be pleased with him); allah's messenger (pbuh)
~~said zamzam water is for what it is drunk for. [reported by ahmed and
~~ibn majah]. this means that when you drink zamzam water you may ask
~~allah (swt) for anything you like to gain or benefit from this water
~~such as healing from illness.... etc while prostrating: narrated abu
~~hurayrah (may allah be pleased with him); allah's messenger (pbuh),
~~said: the nearest a slave can be to his lord (creator) is when he is
~~prostrating, so invoke (supplicate) allah (swt) much. [reported by
~~muslim]. when a muslim is in his salat (prayer) he is facing allah (swt)
~~and when he prostrates he is the nearest he can be to allah (swt) so it
~~is best to invoke allah (swt) at this time. on the day of arafa: the
~~messenger of allah (pbuh) said: the best supplication is the
~~supplication on the day of arafa. [reported by at-tirmidhi and malik].
~~when waking up at night: narrated ubada bin as-samit that allah's

~~narrated abu omamah (may allah be pleased with him); that allah's
~~messenger (pbuh) was asked, o messenger of allah, which supplication is
~~heard (by allah (swt), he said the end of the night and at the end of
~~the obligatory salat (prayer). [reported by at-tirmidhi]. this time is
~~after saying “at-tahyat”, and before making tasleem (finishing prayer).
~~the night of “qadr” (decree): this night is the greatest night of the
~~year. this is the night which the almighty allah (swt) said about it:

~~or veil between it (the supplication of the one who is suffering
~~injustice) and allah (swt) [reported by al-bukhari and muslim]. the one
~~who is suffering injustice is heard by allah (swt) when he invokes allah
~~(swt) to retain his rights from the unjust one. allah (swt) has sworn to
~~help the one who is suffering from injustice sooner or later as prophet
~~mohammad (pbuh) said. the traveler: the messenger of allah (saw) said:

~~supplication of the parent for his child, the supplication of the one
~~who is fasting, and the supplication of the traveler,. [reported by al-
~~bayhaqi and approved by al-albani]. during travel supplication is heard
~~by allah (swt) if the trip is for a good reason, but if the trip is for
~~a bad intention or to perform illegal things (making sins) this will not
~~apply to it. the parents supplication for his child: (see the previous
~~paragraph). conditions of supplication: - one must know that only allah
~~(swt) can answer his supplication and he is the only one who can bring
~~good to him. PageV02P0095
# allah (swt) said: "is not he who responds to the distressed one, when

~~so invoke not anyone along with him" qur'an (72:18) - one must be
~~patient. - one must think positively of allah (swt), must have faith in

~~narrated abu hurayrah (may allah be pleased with him); prophet mohammad
~~(pbuh) said: "supplicate allah with confidence he will answer you"
~~[reported by at-tirmidhi]. mistakes in supplication - invoking other
~~than allah (swt) such as prophets, pious people, stone, idols ... etc
~~this is shirk (polytheism). - wishing to die. some people when they get
~~sick, and they do not heal soon, or they have some personal problems
~~they start wishing for death. - asking allah (swt) to hurry or give his
~~punishment in this life. - asking allah (swt) to break the bond of kin-
~~ship. (such as separating one from his parents). - supplicating for sins
~~to spread in the islamic society. - the “imam” (prayer's leader) making
~~supplication for himself without including the followers in his
~~supplication. (during group prayer, at-taraweh in ramadan). - invoking
~~allah (swt) to see if there is a response without a sense of genuine
~~purpose. - raising the voice during the supplication. it should be done
~~secretly. PageV02P0096
# - saying insha-allah, (allah willing) after the supplication. (ex.: o'
~~allah forgive my sins if you will) narrated abu hurayrah (may allah be

~~should say: o' allah forgive me if you wish, o' allah be merciful to me
~~if you wish, but he should always appeal to allah (swt) with
~~determination, for nobody can force allah (swt) to do something against
~~his will. - invoking allah (swt) aggressively, (asking allah [swt]) for
~~impossible things such as asking him to make you a prophet or
~~immortality). - asking allah (swt) to harm a muslim. - asking allah
~~(swt) to have a muslim commit a sin or die as a non believer. reasons
~~for supplication's acceptance there are some reasons which cause the
~~supplication to be accepted by allah (swt). they are: repentance to
~~allah (swt): the almighty allah (swt) said: “i said (to them): 'ask
~~forgiveness from your lord, verily, he is oft forgiving; he will send
~~rain to you in abundance; and give you increase in wealth and children,
~~and bestow on you gardens and bestow on you rivers” qur'an (71:10,12) -
~~good income: the income must be halal (lawful) as the prophet mohammad
~~(pbuh) was asked by one of his companions, how could i have my
~~supplication responded to? the messenger of allah (pbuh) said: “make
~~your income lawful and your supplication will be responded to”. -
~~perform supererogatory deeds: such as voluntary prayer and voluntary
~~fasting. - chose the preferred time for supplication: (see above).
~~PageV02P0097
# reasons for supplication's rejection as there are reasons for
~~acceptance of a supplication, there are also reasons for rejection of a
~~supplication. here are some reasons which will cause allah (swt) to
~~reject the supplication: 1- illegal income. 2- committing a lot of sins.
~~3- having doubt in allah (swt), or having doubt that he’ll respond to
~~you supplication. 4- being aggressive when supplicating. what happens
~~when supplication is made? when someone invokes allah (swt), one of the
~~following will happen: 1- allah (swt) will respond to the supplicant and
~~he will give him what he asked for. 2- allah (swt) will prevent the
~~supplicant from being harmed. 3- allah (swt) will reward the supplicant
~~with “hasanat” (good reward) which will be kept for him on the day of
~~judgment. selected supplications from the qur’an * “rabana atina fey ad-
~~dunia hasanah wa fey al-akhairatty hasanah waqana addab annar". (our
~~lord, give us in this world that which is good and in the hereafter that
~~which is good, and save us from the torment of the hellfire). (qur'an

~~this great worship of allah (swt). in other words, just imagine, as you
~~are asking promotion from your employer; before anything else you have
~~to do your job in the best way he likes you to do. so you will even work
~~harder and give extra time just to please him. then, you will choose the
~~best time wherein he will be in a good mood, and you will ask him with
~~the best words he likes to hear from you or to please him (your
~~employer). so if you do that you will more likely get what you want from
~~him. think brothers, the same with allah (swt). invoke allah (swt) just

~~you do not get what you asked for, you must know that the problem is

~~insightful look at prayer PageV02P0101
# an insightful look at prayer prayer is the second pillar upon which
~~islam rests, the first pillar being the testimony of faith. islam
~~stresses this act of worship and sternly warns against neglect of it.
~~prayer is the central pillar of faith. it is the key to paradise. it is
~~the first thing to be accounted for on the day of judgment. it is also
~~the first of the religious obligations brought by the prophets after
~~faith in allah. allah says, addressing mûsâ (moses, peace be upon him):
~~“verily i am allah. there is no god but me, so worship me and establish
~~prayer to celebrate my praises.” allah relates to us the supplication of
~~ibrâhîm (abraham, peace be upon him): “my lord, have me and my
~~descendants establish prayer. my lord, accept my supplication.”
~~likewise, ismâ`îl (ishmael, peace be upon him) used to order his family
~~to pray. allah says: “he used to order his family to pray and pay zakâh
~~(alms), and he was pleasing to his lord.” the messiah (peace be upon
~~him) mentioned prayer when he was in the cradle. allah relates his
~~words: “and he enjoined prayer and zakâh (alms) upon me as long as i
~~live.” allah, in the qur’ân, orders the seal of the prophets – muhammad
~~(may the peace and blessings of allah be upon him) – to pray. saying:
~~“recite what your lord reveals to you of the book and establish prayer.”
~~the effects of prayer 1. it enriches the soul and fulfills its yearning
~~to connect with its lord. this gives the soul peace and *******ment. 2.
~~PageV02P0102
# it purifies the heart from the effects of indolence and sin by
~~providing a continuous opportunity for communication with allah and for
~~repentance. the messenger (may the peace and blessings of allah be upon
~~him) indicated this when he said to his companions: “consider if one of
~~you had a river by his door in which he bathed five times a day. would
~~any filth remain on him?” they responded in the negative. he said:
~~“likewise, allah wipes away sins with the five daily prayers.” this
~~stresses the meaning of allah’s words: “verily prayer forbids
~~licentiousness and wrongdoing. and the remembrance of allah is the
~~greatest thing.” 3. it emphasizes the proximity between religion and
~~daily life. life, from an islamic standpoint, is to be directed to
~~allah. life is an opportunity for worship and the remembrance of allah.
~~praying repeatedly throughout the day, interrupting the daily
~~activities, brings about the realization of this concept. the believer,
~~through prayer, acquires a spiritual awareness that he takes with him
~~throughout all of life’s endeavors. 4. it teaches a muslim to respect
~~time and to manage it wisely. prayer shows how important time actually
~~is. allah says: “prayer is enjoined upon the believers at prescribed
~~times.” 5. it teaches the muslim the virtues of constancy and
~~perseverance while opening the door to greater effort and competition.
~~allah’s messenger (may the peace and blessings of allah be upon him)
~~said: “the best of deeds with allah are the ones performed most
~~regularly, even if it is small.” 6. PageV02P0103

~~والعالم الحديث (الجزء الأول) islamic morality and today’s world part one
~~islamic morality and today’s world: part one morality is both an
~~individual and social phenomenon. it tells you how to be happy. it's a
~~kind of a secret a key that guides you to get the maximum joy, pleasure,
~~meaning, satisfaction, peace of mind, and many other good things out of
~~life. and islamic morality teaches the muslim how to win the never-
~~ending battle royal of good vs. evil. western civilisation scoffs at the
~~very mention of words such as morality, decency and modesty. these are
~~regarded as old-fashioned and incongruous with today’s culture of
~~liberalism and unfettered freedom. immodesty, immorality, shamelessness
~~and fornication are regarded as progressive and fashionable. yet this
~~has been the very cause of the destruction of today's family. too many a
~~happy home has broken due to infidelity, leaving in its trail misery,
~~heartache and an unstable society. fornication also leads to
~~illegitimate and unwanted children who become a massive problem unto
~~society due to lack of proper parental supervision. immorality is truly
~~a curse on mankind and society. the country that prides itself in being
~~the superpower of today’s world and the leader of present day
~~civilisation, the united states of america is reeling under the impact
~~of immorality. today every other child in the u.s. is born out of
~~wedlock. PageV02P0104
# thirty-eight percent of children now live without a biological father;
~~6.6 million children live with divorced single parents, mostly mothers
~~whose ex-husbands tend to fade away from their children. this is family
~~life in usa. "something is wrong with the entire american family,"
~~writes martin marty, professor at the university of chicago, in the los
~~angles times. "one has the weird sense that america is a country with
~~many children but without adults." this gruesome picture is the direct
~~result of the absence of morality, decency and modesty in the u.s. and,
~~unfortunately most of the western world, and parts of eastern societies.
~~today, adultery and fornication are no longer viewed as the deadly
~~crimes and sins they really are and are in fact commonplace. married men
~~are expected to have several mistresses in some places. premarital sex
~~is now considered quite acceptable, normal, well within the bounds of
~~morality, and indeed desirable. it has been this way for a long time and
~~you can say it has become part of the "american way". dating begins at a
~~very young age and every socially well-adjusted youngster is expected to
~~have several girlfriends and boyfriends by a certain age. couples are
~~expected to live together. those who grow up in the west are weaned on
~~sex in both subtle and not so subtle ways. it is quickly learned through
~~t.v. shows, commercials, movies, advertisements, songs, you name it,
~~that being sexy is a desired goal and aim in life. PageV02P0105
# even comic books abound with superheroes and heroines with
~~fantastically well-proportioned bodies and they lead sexually active
~~private lives where little is left to the imagination. animated cartoon
~~characters from betty boop to jessica rabbit make the message crystal
~~clear about what makes a female desirable. the top selling video and
~~computer games feature female characters with sexy bodies whose biggest
~~audiences are adolescent boys and young men. females are intensely
~~focused on being sexually attractive and are conditioned to be so from
~~the time they get their first barbie. this is what makes the fashion,
~~cosmetic and entertainment industries thrive. countless young girls
~~admire and aspire to be 'superstar' beauty queens, models, singers, or
~~actresses. there is a phenomenal proliferation of ‘fan’ or entertainment
~~magazines that feature the hottest entertainment stars who are known
~~precisely for their sex appeal. the highest rated t.v. talk shows are
~~those that commonly feature people who expose their most intimate and
~~outlandish sexual behavior. moreover, homosexuality has now become
~~accepted by a large number of people particularly in the west as well as
~~in other circles that are "westernized". an indication of this changed
~~attitude is the fact that homosexuals are no longer portrayed as
~~abnormal. apparently homosexuality has become largely accepted by
~~americans and europeans even if some of them personally do not practice
~~it. PageV02P0106
# accepted in so much as no one will report or condemn or discriminate
~~against a homosexual in most areas unless they are flagrantly offensive
~~in their mannerisms and behavior. pornography of all types and levels is
~~a multi-billion dollar industry having increased in leaps and bounds
~~within just the last decade. despite these realities, the entertainers
~~and their producers, advertisers, writers and the like will claim that
~~they do not adversely affect the habits of people at all. they insist
~~that they don’t negatively influence society in any way. at the very
~~same time most of them will say that one of the most gratifying rewards
~~of their professions is the effect they have upon people! after all that
~~liberation, a woman's worth is still tied to her level of physical
~~attractiveness which is still considered her only asset and one to be
~~exploited in the worst and most demeaning way. males are increasingly
~~judged in this way but not to the degree as are females. even the modern
~~‘super-woman power-executive’ who is supposed to be respected for her
~~intellect and authority still wears a mid-thigh skirt. she expects...
~~PageV02P0107
# no demands, to be viewed as absolutely equal to her male counterpart,
~~yet does she really believe that when dressed this way her worth is not
~~at all being judged based on her looks by even the unemployed vagrant
~~she passes by on the way to work? even in the face of this staggering
~~toll in human suffering and degradation, the disbelievers and doubters
~~in islam still ask: you muslims say that islam orders women to be all
~~covered up (veiled)?! they can't wear whatever they please shouldn't go
~~out perfumed?! you're not supposed to go out on dates? you shouldn't
~~listen to sexually explicit songs!? no swimming or visiting the public
~~beaches in the summer (for women)?! not even the same sex should see
~~each other in scanty, skin-tight, or see-through clothing or even shower
~~together at the gym?! you really place great value on chastity, modesty
~~and virginity until marriage?! you encourage that men be jealous for and
~~protective of their wives?! premarital sex is a punishable crime and
~~adultery is a capital offense?! no sex unless you are married to your
~~partner?! you can marry up to four women?!! islam sets the highest
~~possible standard of morality. this is bound to provide limitless
~~avenues for the moral evolution of humanity. by making divine

~~two PageV02P0109
# islamic morality and today’s world: part two islam does not minimize
~~the importance of the well-known moral norms, nor does it give
~~exaggerated importance to some and neglect others without cause. it
~~takes up all the commonly known moral virtues and with a sense of
~~balance and proportion it assigns a suitable place and function to each
~~one of them in the total scheme of life. it widens the scope of man's
~~individual and collective life - his domestic associations, his civic
~~conduct, and his activities in the political, economic, legal,
~~educational, and social realms. it covers his life from home to society,
~~from the dining-table to the battlefield and peace conferences,
~~literally from the cradle to the grave. in short, no sphere of life is
~~exempt from the universal and comprehensive application of the moral
~~principles of islam. it makes morality reign supreme and ensures that
~~the affairs of life, instead of dominated by selfish desires and petty
~~interests, should be regulated by norms of morality. moreover, islam
~~lays down a system of life which is based on all good and is free from
~~all evil. it invokes the people, not only to practice virtue, but also
~~to establish virtue and eradicate vice, to bid good and to forbid wrong.
~~those who respond to this call are gathered together into a community
~~and given the name "muslim". and the singular object underlying the
~~formation of this community ("ummah") is that it should make an
~~organized effort to establish and enforce goodness and suppress and
~~eradicate evil. PageV02P0110
# purity in morals is regarded by islam as a cornerstone of a stable and
~~healthy family and society. anything that threatens to destroy the moral
~~fiber of society and the family life is regarded as seriously offensive
~~in islam. for example, fornication, whether it be premarital or
~~extramarital, is an act that undermines a stable family life. no wife
~~accepts the fact that her husband is cheating on her or vice-versa.
~~therefore, islam has declared adultery as strictly forbidden. adultery
~~is regarded as a very serious offence; the fornicator has been strongly
~~condemned. in an islamic state, it carries the maximum punishment
~~available under the law. not only has islam condemned adultery. anything
~~that is deemed to stir the passions or that may ultimately lead towards
~~temptation and thus the sin of adultery has also been condemned and
~~declared unlawful in islam. in this way, the door to evil and vice has
~~been effectively closed. it is a case of removing the hay far away from
~~the bonfire rather than trying to control the bonfire and hoping
~~wishfully that the hay would somehow not burn. this analogy sums up the
~~islamic outlook on morality as compared to that of the west. some of the
~~other measures adopted by islam to protect and promote morality is the
~~prohibition of lustful gazes from either male or female towards each
~~other. another measure is the emphasis on covering parts of the body
~~that evoke lustful feelings and emotions. this is encompassed in islam’s
~~dress code. the muslim woman has been ordered in islam to cover the
~~whole of her body except her hands and her face. PageV02P0111
# this covering not only discourages undesirable attention towards her,
~~but also accords her a degree of respect, honor and dignity and of being
~~in charge of her body and experiencing a sense of power over herself.
~~males are also required to cover certain parts of their bodies.(what's
~~between the belly and the knees). the one and only way of reverse the
~~rot, previously mentioned, in our world and restore the lost dignity to
~~mankind is to return to the path of morality and modesty given in islam.
~~this will grant us the peaceful pure life we all need, and make us feel
~~that we were brought to life as human beings not animals. indeed islam
~~is a religion for all ages. source http://www.islamonline.com/cgi-

~~ellah ela allah–a way of life for muslims PageV02P0112
# la ellah ela allah–a way of life for muslims "la llaha illa allah,
~~muhammad rasul allah" -"there is no god except allah" - is the first
~~part of the islamic declaration of faith, meaning that there is no one
~~to be worshipped except god; "muhammad rasul allah" - "muhammad is the
~~messenger of god"- is the second part, meaning that this worship is to
~~be carried out according to the teachings of the prophet - peace be upon
~~him. a believing muslim is one whose heart has been penetrated
~~completely with this declaration, as the other pillars of islam and
~~articles of faith are derivatives of it. thus, belief in angels, god's
~~books, god's messengers, the life hereafter, al-qadr (the measurement of
~~good and evil), praying (al-salat), fasting (al-siyam), almsgiving (al-
~~zakat) and pilgrimage (al-hajj), and the limits set by god of
~~permissible and forbidden things, human affairs, laws, islamic moral
~~teachings, and so on, are all based on the foundation of worship of god,
~~and the source of all these teachings is prophet muhammad (pbuh). allah
~~(swt) says: (whoever obeys the prophet obeys god) [qur’an 4:80] the
~~declaration of faith provides the foundation for a complete system of
~~life for the muslim community in all its details. thus, a muslim
~~community must sustain a practical interpretation of the declaration of
~~faith and all its characteristics; and the society which does not
~~translate this declaration into practice is not a true muslim society.
~~this way of life cannot come into being without securing this foundation
~~first. PageV02P0113
# if the system of life is constructed on some other foundation, or if
~~other sources are mixed with this foundation, then that community cannot
~~be considered islamic. allah (swt) says: (the command belongs to god
~~alone. he commands you not to worship anyone except him. this is the
~~right way of life.) [qur’an 12:40] this concise and decisive declaration
~~of faith guides muslims in the basic questions of their religion and in
~~its practical movement. first, it guides to the nature of the muslim
~~community; second, it shows the method of constructing such a community;
~~third, it tells how to confront ignorant, and disbelieving societies;
~~and fourth, it determines the method by which islam changes human life.
~~the distinctive feature of a muslim community is that all its affairs
~~are based on worship of god alone. the declaration of faith expresses
~~this principle and determines its character; in beliefs, in devotional
~~acts, and in rules and regulations. a person who does not believe in the
~~oneness of god does not worship god alone. allah (swt) says: (allah
~~commands you not to take two gods. god is only one; hence fear me.
~~whatever is in the heavens and the earth belongs to him and follows his
~~way. will you the fear anyone other than god?) [qur’an 16:52] anyone who
~~performs devotional acts before someone other than allah does not
~~worship god alone. (say, my salat (prayers), my acts of devotion, my
~~life and my death, are for the sustainer of the worlds; he has no
~~associate. i have been commanded this, and i am the foremost to be among
~~the submitters.) PageV02P0114
# [qur’an 6:163] also anyone who derives laws from a source other than
~~god, in a way other than what he taught us through prophet muhammad
~~(pbuh) does not worship god alone. (are there associates of god who have
~~made permissible for them in their religion that which god has not
~~permitted?) [qur’an 42:21] (whatever the prophet gives you, accept it,
~~and whatever he prohibits you, refrain from it.) [qur’an 59:7] in the
~~muslim society, the beliefs, ideas, devotional and religious acts, the
~~social system and its laws, should be based on submission to god alone.
~~it is necessary, therefore, before thinking of establishing the islamic
~~social system and organizing a muslim community, that one should give
~~attention to purifying the hearts of people from the worship of anyone
~~other than god. only those whose hearts are so purified will be true
~~muslims, and only these people can start a true muslim community. anyone
~~who wants to live an islamic life will automatically enter into this
~~community, and his belief, acts of worship and the laws which he
~~follows, will also be purified for god alone. in other words, he will be
~~an embodiment of "la ilaha illa allah, muhammadar rasul allah". this was
~~the basis on which the foundation of the first muslim community was
~~established which eventually developed into the first muslim nation.

~~what prayer means to me PageV02P0115
# what prayer means to me ? five times a day i retreat from life, pause
~~and renew my intention for living. it's not just kids and work, fun and
~~problems. there's more, much more ..... lying just beneath the surface
~~of our everyday thoughts. if we dare to peer within, we'll find it, the
~~home of peace; of truth ; an acute awareness of what is wrong and right,
~~of what is worthwhile and what is wasted. i stand still and concentrate
~~on the spot on the carpet where my forehead will soon rest, casting
~~aside all worries, fears and hopes, and focusing on the only one who can
~~help, who can forgive, who is well-aware of everything. quietly, so only
~~myself can hear, i recite the verses of qu'ran that remind us, in every
~~prayer, of the one who showers mercy of those who deserve it and those
~~who don't. the one to whom, all judgment lies and whom we are all to
~~return to, at an appointed time. i remember that no one can help me, no
~~one can waylay my fears, no one can turn the tide of events, except the
~~one to whom all help is sought. when anger strikes my heart, i recite
~~the verses that remind us of mercy, tolerance and forgiveness; raising
~~the consciousness to see through the empty words that people speak, to
~~the meaning that may have been intended. so i forgive. when worries
~~cloud my mind and i'm busy planning what i should do, i recite those
~~verses telling of good deeds and trust in the lord of all. the best of
~~planners, the subduer of evil and the exalter of whom he pleases. so , i
~~try my best, ask for help and leave the rest to allah s.w.t.
~~PageV02P0116
# when i feel sad and lost, i recite the verses promising victory to
~~those who strive to uphold piety, that place of rest and peace that lies
~~not so far ahead and the source of all peace whose help is always near.
~~so, i wipe away my tears and keep on trying, never giving up. my prayer,
~~is a way of life. it comes five times a day but the rest of the time is
~~in preparation for the next, awareness of the passing time, remembering
~~my duty to my creator and my responsibility to my own soul. so whatever
~~i'm doing, i stop and put it aside, wash and stand in prayer, trying to
~~look within, at the faults that follow me around in my life, of the evil
~~my hands have sent forth, and seek guidance, forgiveness and escape from
~~the evil consequences of what i may have done. i think of the marvels of
~~the universe, how infinately beautiful and amazing as they are. the
~~wonders of my own self, the physical human body and the wonders it
~~contains. the depth and breadth of the mind, that few of us can compass
~~and then i look to the trivial pleasures of life, the transient nature
~~of our existence and i feel an urge to do more, to try harder, to be
~~better than i was the day before. and so i bow before my creator,
~~acknowledging the fact that only he deserves my sincerity, my obedience
~~and my love. all else in life, is secondary to the fact that if he
~~hadn't chosen to create me, i would never have existed. here i am!
~~here's my duty. worship is not only prayer and fasting but the way we
~~live, the way we speak, the way we treat people and the way we solve
~~problems. PageV02P0117
# knowing that we weren't only created and left to discern truth for
~~ourselves, i adhere to the guidance given to me , to steady me on the
~~path that leads to success in this life and the next. i continue in my
~~prayer, whether well or ill, tired or wakeful, sad or hopeful, i
~~continue, knowing that success doesn't lie in the amount of money,

~~: نطق الشهادتين والصلاة declaring shahaadah and performing salaat
~~PageV02P0118
# i have read the many pages of your web site that instructs a non-
~~believer. i believe that there is only allah (one god). ibelieve that
~~muhammed is the seal of the prophets. history bears this out. my
~~question is: how do i declare this (shahadah) if i do not speak arabic?
~~how do i perform the five daily prayers (salah) without understanding
~~arabic? finally would i have to change my name? to the dear inquirer: i
~~welcome you with a warm greeting. i was besieged with great joy as i
~~discovered your question while browsing through the ten questions which
~~arrived during the past hour today, and it was the dearest question for
~~me. this fact is not surprising, as how could our hearts not open to a
~~wise man who has discovered the truth and has acknowledged and confirmed
~~it for himself--one who wishes to embrace islaam and asks about the next
~~steps? in reality, everything that poses a problem for you is actually
~~an easy matter, and can be solved simply, god willing (in shaa' allaah),
~~so let's take them one by one: first: all that is required of you to
~~embrace this religion right now as you are reading these lines is to
~~pronounce al-shahaadatain, or the two confirmations and attestations of
~~faith, to the best of your ability. PageV02P0119
# perfect pronunciation of the arabic letters is not required, and the
~~following is a transliteration of the phrases with english letters to
~~help you: ash-hadu an laa ilaahah illallaah (i bear witness and attest
~~that there is no god worthy of worship but the one god allaah) ash-hadu
~~anna muhammad-ar-rasool ullaah (i bear witness and attest that muhammad
~~is the messenger of allaah) after pronouncing them, you should promptly
~~hasten to take a shower to purify yourself and prepare to start
~~performing your regular prayers which will be an obligation as soon as
~~you have declared your belief. second: if you have not yet learned the
~~manner and characteristics of performing the prayer (i.e. at least the
~~movements and positions), appended to this message is a de******ion from
~~which you can learn. what is requried from you for the time being is to
~~say in the beginning of the prayer and between each movement between
~~positions "allaahu ak-bar" (a glorification of allaah). while standing,
~~bowing, prostrating, and sitting, you should say "subhaan allaah wal-
~~hamdu lillaah wa-laa ilaaha illallaahu wallaahu akbar." (glory be to
~~allaah, and praise and thanks be to allaah, and there is no god but
~~allaah, and allaah is the most exalted and great.) then conclude the
~~prayer by turning your head to the right then left, each time saying
~~"as-salaamu alaikum." this way of performing salaat is permissible for
~~you until you can learn and memorize what should be said in each
~~movement and position of the salaat. PageV02P0120
# third: you are not required to change your name, and in fact, a number
~~of scholars among the forefathers and modern-day muslims have indicated
~~declared that your name is in fact the name of one of the prophets! i
~~ask allaah to aid you and ease your affairs, and to bestow upon you the

~~manner he has prescribed. islam also has certain pillars and duties. the
~~key to all of this is to bear witness that there is no god worthy of
~~worship except allaah and that muhammad is the messenger of allaah.
~~obtaining an official certificate from an islamic centre as proof of
~~your islam so that you can use it to get permission to go for hajj and
~~enter the holy places is a means which you must use in order to go for
~~hajj in the future, but it is not a condition that is necessary for you
~~to become muslim or start to do the acts of worship such as salaah
~~(prayer) etc. when a person becomes muslim he becomes a member of the
~~muslim ummah and is connected to all the muslims who believe in one god
~~by the bonds of islamic brotherhood which includes friendship and mutual
~~help and support, as allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): “the
~~believers are nothing else than brothers (in islamic religion)” [al-
~~hujuraat 49:10] “the believers, men and women, are auliya’ (helpers,
~~supporters, friends, protectors) of one another; they enjoin (on the
~~people) al-ma‘roof (i.e. islamic monotheism and all that islam orders
~~one to do), and forbid (people) from al-munkar (i.e. PageV02P0122
# polytheism and disbelief of all kinds, and all that islam has
~~forbidden); they perform as-salaah (iqaamat-as-salaah), and give the
~~zakaah, and obey allaah and his messenger. allaah will have his mercy on
~~them. surely, allaah is all-mighty, all-wise” [al-tawbah 9:71] islam q&a

~~translated into: i bear witness to that there is no deity worthy of

~~great way to master the performance of salaat (prayer) is to learn from
~~other muslims face to face. each prayer of the day must be performed
~~according to its time slot in the day. here is the following order: fajr
~~(morning prayer) begins about one hour and twenty minutes before sunrise
~~and ends about ten minutes before sunrise. duhr (noon prayer) begins
~~when the sun passes the meridian and ends about two and a half hours
~~afterwards. asr (afternoon prayer) begins from the time the noon prayer
~~time ends and ends about 10 minutes before sunset. maghrib (sunset)
~~begins soon after sunset ends and ends before darkness approaches. isha
~~(night prayer) begins from the time the sunset prayer ends and extends
~~till just before the morning prayer. for exact timings of each prayer,
~~obtain a prayer ti****ble from your nearest masjid or any muslim

# the partial ablution (wudu') the partial ablution (wudu') before
~~offering the prayer one must be in good shape and pure condition. it is
~~necessary to wash the parts of the body which are generally exposed to
~~dirt or dust or smog. this performance is called ablution (wudu') and is
~~preferably carried out as follows:
~~http://www.islamicity.com/graphics/wudy.gif 1. declare the intention
~~that the act is for the purpose of worship and purity, start by saying
~~bismillah. 2. wash the hands up to the wrists, three times. 3. rinse out
~~the mouth with water, three times, preferably with a brush whenever it
~~is possible. 4. cleanse the nostrils of the nose by sniffing water into
~~them, three times. 5. wash the whole face three times with both hands,
~~if possible, from the top of the forehead to the bottom of the chin and
~~from ear to ear. 6. wash the right arm three times up to the far end of
~~the elbow, and then do the same with the left arm. 7. wipe the whole
~~head or any part of it with a wet hand, once. 8. wipe the inner sides of
~~the ears with the forefingers and their outer sides with the thumbs.
~~this should be done with wet fingers. 9 wash the two feet up to the
~~ankles, three times, beginning with the right foot. at this stage the
~~ablution is completed, and the person who has performed it is ready to
~~start to start his prayer.when the ablution is valid a person may keep
~~it as long as he can, and may use it for as many prayers as he wishes.
~~but it is preferable to renew it as often as possible. PageV02P0124
# it is also preferable to do it in the said order, although it will be
~~accepted from those who fail to keep this order. ablution in the said
~~way is sufficient for prayer unless it is nullified.by any reason.
~~nullification of the ablution the ablution becomes nullified by any of
~~the following 1. natural discharges, i.e., urine, stools, gas, etc... 2.
~~the flow of blood or pus and the like from any part of the body; 3.
~~vomiting; 4. falling asleep; 5. losing one's reason by taking drugs or
~~any intoxicating stuff. after the occurrence of any of these things the
~~ablution must be renewed for prayer. also, after natural discharges,
~~water should be applied because the use of toilet tissues may not be
~~sufficient for the purpose of purity and worship. the complete ablution
~~(ghusl/bath) the whole body with the nostrils, mouth and head must be
~~washed by a complete bath before commencing prayer in any of the
~~following cases: 1. after intimate intercourse; 2. after wet dreams; or
~~night discharge; 3. upon expiration of the menstruation period of women;
~~4. at the end of the confinement period of nursing women, which, is
~~estimated at a maximum of forty days. if it ends before, complete
~~ablution should be done. it should be pointed out that at the start of
~~the bath or ablution the intention must be clear that it is for the
~~purpose of purity and worship. also, a person who is performing an
~~ablution, partial or complete, should combine his performance with some
~~utterances glorifying god and asking him for true guidance. PageV02P0125
# the forms of such utterances are described in detail in the elaborate
~~sources of the religion. one, however, can say one's own best utterances
~~if one does not know the exact wording. that is sufficient as long as it
~~is in the praise of god and is said with sincerity. source
~~http://www.islamicity.com/mosque/salat/salat6.htm شروط الصلاة rules of
~~prayer PageV02P0126
# rules of prayer before attempting any sort of prayer, our bodies
~~should be totally purified. in order for us to be in this state, he or
~~she must perform something called wudu (ablution). again, the best way
~~to learn wudu is to watch others face to face. here are the steps for
~~wudu: the first step in performing wudu, is to have the intentions of
~~purifying your heart. rinse your palms up the wrist three times; right
~~palm first then your left rinse your mouth 3 times. (preferably with
~~three gargles) wash nose by sniffing in it three times. wash the face
~~three times making sure that water reaches all the areas of you face.
~~then was each hand up to the elbow three times, right hand first then
~~your left hand. wipe your hand (hair) with wet hands, and then rub the
~~ears with wet hands. finally, wash your feet up to the ankle three times
~~starting with the right foot. you are able to maintain the state of wudu
~~unless you attend the call of nature, pass wind, sleep, or become
~~unconscious. now, if a person was in a major state of impurity resulting
~~from actions like, i.e. intercourse or semen discharge, then he must
~~perform ghusl (bathing) women should also carry out this cleansing to
~~purify themselves after intercourse, wet dreams, or recovering from
~~menstrual period and child birth. the procedure for ghusl (bathing) is
~~as follows: make the intention for ghusl (ceremonial bath) wash the
~~private parts, perform ablution (wudu) as you do before prayer, pour
~~water over the head wash the whole body, head and hair thoroughly so as
~~not to leave a dry spot. PageV02P0127
# wash feet before getting out of bathing area thank and praise allah
~~and supplicate him. it is required that a muslim perform ghusl once a
~~week, that is on friday before the congregational prayers but a daily
~~bath is hygienically preferred. women are excused from prayers on days
~~of menstruation and childbirth period. source

# how to perform prayer prayer is the difference from the believer and
~~the non-believer and should be done in complete humility and
~~submissiveness to allah. prayer requires a person to have complete
~~concentration when performing prayer. also, performing prayer should not
~~converse, look around or attend to any worldly matters during the
~~prayer. certain prayers of the day are performed differently from one
~~another. first, lets see how the morning prayer is performed. the first
~~thing one should do is face the kaba (the holy house of allah) raise
~~their hands to behind their ears and say allahu akbar. then lower the
~~hands and place the right hand over the left one above the navel. then
~~recite the fatiha (opening chapter of the quran): bismillah ir rahman ir
~~raheem. alhamdullah rabbil alameen. ar rahman ir raheem. maliki yawmid
~~deen. iyyaka nabudu wa iyyaka nasta'een. ihdinas siratal mustakeem -
~~siraatal ladeena an amtaalayhim gayril maghdoobi alayhum, waladdaallin
~~ameen. following the fatiha, one should recite any sura from the quran.
~~for example is chapter 112 (sura ikhlas). qul hu wallahu ahad, allahus
~~samad, lam yalid wa lam yulid, walaam yakin lahoo qufuwan ahad. after
~~the completion of the sura, say allahu akbar and then bow down, bending
~~your hands and knees. this position is called ruku, and in this position
~~recite three times: subhana rabbiyaal azeem. after that, the standing
~~position is resumed with three words, "sami allahu liman hamidah,
~~rabbana wa lakal hamd" then say allahu akbar and prostrate yourself down
~~with your forehead touching the ground. PageV02P0129
# this position is called sujud. in this position, recite three times,
~~"subhana rabiyaal ala. saying allahu akbar, resume the erect sitting
~~position while saying "allahu akbar"; then again prostrate by saying
~~"allahu akbar" and repeating three times, subhana rabiyaal ala while in
~~prostration. then stand upright saying "allahu akbar" this completes one
~~unit or one rakah. after the first rakah, perform the second one exactly
~~the same way you did the first one. in the second one, after you say
~~perform your second prostration recitals, you remain in the erect
~~sitting position and repeating the following of what is called
~~tashahhud; attahiyatt lilahi wa'salawat wa tayyibat. asaalamu alaika
~~ayyuhan nabi wa rahmutullah wa barakat. asaalaam alayna wa ala
~~ibadillahis saliheen. pointing your index finger straight, say ashadu
~~ana la ihlahi illallah, wa ashadu anna muhammadan abduhoo wa rasoolooh.
~~following this, you then recite the following of what is called durud:
~~allahuma salli ala sayyiddna muhammad wa ali sayyiddna muhammad, kama
~~sallayta ala sayyiddna ibraheem wa ala ali sayyiddna ibraheem wa barik
~~ala sayyiddna muhammad, wa ala ali sayyiddna muhammad, kama barakta ala
~~sayyiddna ibraheem wa ala ali sayiddna ibraheem, fil alameen innaka
~~hamidun majeed" after this, you turn your head to the right and say
~~asalaam alaykum wa rahmatullah wa baraktu and then turn your head to the
~~left and repeat the same. PageV02P0130

~~(units) in the five obligitory prayers prayer number of units fajr early
~~morning 2 duhr early afternoon 4 asr late afternoon 4 maghrib after
~~sunset 3 isha night 4 the first two rakah of these prayers are performed
~~in the same manner as the morning prayer. but after reciting the
~~tashahhud you should stand and continue to pray the third rakah (unit)
~~reciting only sura fatiha and not joining it with other passages of the
~~quran. then in the fourth rakah, after the second sajdah (prostration)
~~sit down as you do in the second rakah and recite tashahhud, durud,
~~supplication and ending the prayer as above. the maghrib prayer (sunset)
~~consists of three rakah. first two rakah are the same as above. stand up
~~for the third rakah reciting sura fatiha, then complete this rakah as
~~you did the fourth rakah above. it is highly recommended that all people
~~perform the five daily prayers in congregation in a mosque and we should
~~make our world activities revolved around the five daily prayers. on
~~fridays, the muslims perform prayers in congregation, the juma prayer. a
~~khutba or sermon precedes this prayer. it consists of two rakah during
~~which the imam recites sura fatiha and then follows up with another
~~verse. this prayer replaces the noon prayer and it is obligatory for all
~~muslims to attend the friday prayers. all mosques hold the juma prayers
~~each friday. source

~~أداء الصلوات how to improve your daily prayers PageV02P0135
# how to improve your daily prayers? prophet muhammad (pbuh) emphasized
~~that praying is considered the back-bone of islam. it is very important
~~that muslims make sure they perform their daily prayers properly, as
~~commanded by allah and as explained by prophet muhammad (pbuh). here are
~~some tips that muslims can use to improve their prayers; 1-in islam, it
~~is highly recommended that muslims perform the obligatory prayers in
~~congregation (with a group: “jama’a”). allah (swt) orders muslims to bow
~~and prostrate to him; (and observe prayer and pay the zakat
~~(almsgiving), and bow down with those who bow.) [qur’an 2:43] there are
~~many saying by prophet muhammad (pbuh) that discuss the virtue and
~~importance of performing prayers in congregation. ibn omar quoted
~~prophet muhammad (pbuh) as saying; "the reward of praying (salah)
~~performed in congregation outweighs that of (salah) performed
~~individually by twenty-seven degrees." (al-bukhari and muslim) 2-muslims
~~should arrange their life according to their prayers, and they should
~~understand the difference between performing prayers on time and
~~delaying them. when prayers are carried out on time, they will be much
~~more effective than postponed prayers. 3-muslims must try to do a
~~routine amount of supplementary prayers (nafl) because they are regarded
~~as a compensation for obligatory prayers that were done in a weak
~~manner. 4-although it is not obligatory, but to improve one's prayer, it
~~is always better to ******* our ablution even if it is still valid from
~~our last prayer. PageV02P0136
# ablution is primarily for physical cleansing but it is also considered
~~a symbol of spiritual cleansing. muslims should not engage in worldly
~~affairs after performing ablution, they should go directly to prayers.
~~5-muslims should start their prayers with “takbir” (saying allaho
~~akbar), this is the point when we must disconnect from the outer world,
~~and begin a direct communication with allah. 6-bowing and prostration
~~(sujood) are signs of giving in selfishness and they should be
~~considered as a feeling of humbleness in front of allah (swt). however,
~~prostration is a higher degree of humbleness before allah (swt), because
~~bowing is not enough to show the humble feeling of a believer. 7-muslims
~~must never take the “tashahod” in the last part of their prayers
~~lightly. in fact, “tashahod” is the concluding part of the prayer. it is
~~the stage when you renew your allegiance to allah and his messenger. 8-
~~muslims must dress properly when praying, because praying is talking to
~~allah, and one should do his/her best when standing before allah,
~~narrating his words. your attire should be decent and clean, your hair
~~should be combed, it is preferable that you brush your teeth and
~~moderately perfume yourself. 9- before praying, one can prepare himself
~~by saying “iqama” with concentration and doing “istighfar” (to ask for
~~allah’s forgiveness). 10- the short pause after “rokoo” before
~~prostration (sojood) is very important, it is narrated that prophet
~~muhammad (pbuh) used to stay long in these pausing positions.
~~PageV02P0137
# 11- allah says in the qur’an that praying restrains from shameful sins
~~(fahesha), therefore muslims should perform their prayers with a clear
~~conscious, and they should avoid shameful and unjust deeds to be able to
~~stand before allah (swt) in their prayers. 12-muslims must avoid
~~hypocrisy “reya’a” when it comes to praying, one of the signs of
~~hypocrisy could be praying in the presence of others and ignoring
~~prayers while alone. the benefits of praying are achieved in your heart,
~~between yourself and allah, and not with others. middle east advertising

~~is excretion from anything human or animalistic. it is a must for humans
~~to wipe off the last drops of urine from their bodies with tissue paper
~~and to not allow specks of dried feces to cling to any parts of their

~~find water and wash away thoroughly all the impurities on them. also

~~should wash away any and all discharges received from animals during
~~play, etc. this includes the saliva from dogs on the human body,
~~clothing, or on dishes used by humans for food. also considered impure
~~is unnecessary hair on the body. hair of the underarms and pubic area is
~~considered unnecessary and undesirable and should be removed regularly.
~~circumsicion for muslims is strongly recommended because of its health
~~advantages such as cleanliness and reducing the risk of cancers in that

~~المسلم على أخيه المسلم give your fellow muslims their rights
~~PageV02P0147
# give your fellow muslims their rights abu hurayrah (radhiyallaahu
~~'anhu - may allah be pleased with him) narrated that the messenger of
~~allaah (sallallaahu 'alayhi wa sallam - may the peace and blessings of
~~allah be upon him) said, "the rights of a muslim upon their fellow
~~muslim are six." it was said, "and what are they oh messenger of
~~allaah?" he replied, " when you meet them, give them the greeting of
~~peace, (assalamo alykum wa rehmatullahe wa barakaatuh) when they invite
~~you, respond to their invitation, when they seek your advice, advise
~~them sincerely, when they sneeze and praise allaah, supplicate for mercy
~~upon them, when they fall ill, visit them, and when they die follow them
~~(i.e. his funeral)." muslim the first right: "when you meet them, give
~~them the greeting of peace." for verily the greeting of peace is a cause
~~of love one another, which results in producing faith (al-eemaan), which
~~results in the person entering the paradise. this is as prophet
~~(sallallaahu 'alayhi wa sallam) said, "by the one in whose hand is my
~~soul, you all will not enter into the paradise until you believe, and
~~you will not believe until you love each other. shall i not direct you
~~to something that if you do it, you will love each other? spread the
~~greeting of peace amongst yourselves." the greeting of peace is from the
~~virtuous characteristics of islaam. for verily each of the two people
~~who meet each other supplicates for the other for safety from evils, and
~~mercy, and blessing that brings about every good. PageV02P0148
# and what follows this is a cheerful face and appropriate words of
~~greeting which result in unity and love, and it removes feelings of
~~estrangement and cold disassociation. thus, giving the greeting of peace
~~is the right of the muslim, and it is obligatory upon the person who is
~~greeted to return greeting with a similar greeting or one that is better
~~than it. and the best of the people are those who start the greeting of
~~peace first. the second right: "when they invite you, respond to their
~~invitation." this means that when he invites you with an invitation to
~~some food and drink, then fulfill the request of your brother who has
~~drawn near to you and honored you with the invitation. respond to his
~~invitation (i.e. accept it), unless you have an excuse. the third right:
~~his statement, "and when they seek your advice, advise them sincerely."
~~this means that if he seeks consultation with you regarding some action,
~~as to whether he should do it or not, then advise him with that which
~~you would like for yourself. thus, if the action is something that is
~~beneficial in all aspects, then encourage him to do that, and if it is
~~something harmful, then warn him against it. and if the action contains
~~both benefit and harm, then explain that to him and weigh the benefits
~~against the harms. likewise, if he consults with you concerning some
~~dealing with someone among the people, or whether he should marry a
~~woman off to someone, or whether he should marry someone, then extend
~~your pure and sincere advice to him, and deal with him from the view
~~point of what you would do for you own self. PageV02P0149
# and avoid deceiving him in any matter of these things. for verily
~~whoever deceives the muslims, then he is not of them, and indeed he has
~~left off the obligation of being sincere and advising. and this
~~sincerity and advising is absolutely obligatory, however it becomes more
~~emphasized when the person seeks your advice and he requests from you
~~that you give him a beneficial opinion. for this reason the prophet
~~(sallallaahu 'alayhi wa sallam) specifically mentioned it in this
~~important situation. the fourth right: "and when they sneeze and praise
~~allaah, then pray for mercy upon them." this is due to the fact that
~~sneezing is a favor from allaah, in the expelling of this congested air
~~that is blocked in certain parts of the body of the human being. allaah
~~makes it easy for this air to have a passage out where it can exit, and
~~thus the sneezing person feels relief. thus, the prophet (sallallaahu
~~'alayhi wa sallam) legislated that the person praise allaah for this
~~favor, and he legislated for his (muslim) brother to say to him, "may
~~allaah have mercy upon you." he also commanded the person who sneezed to
~~answer his (muslim) brother by saying to him, "may allaah guide you and
~~set right your affairs." therefore, whoever does not praise allaah, then
~~he does not deserve for others to pray for mercy upon him, and in this
~~case he cannot blame anyone except himself. for he is the one who has
~~caused himself to lose the two blessings: the blessing of praising
~~allaah, and the blessing of his brother's supplication for him that is a
~~result of the praising. PageV02P0150
# the fifth right: his statement, "and when they fall ill, visit them."
~~visiting the sick is from the rights of the muslim, and especially for
~~the person who has a highly stressed and emphasized right upon you, like
~~the relative, and the friend, and so forth. it is from the best of the
~~righteous deeds. and whoever visits their fellow muslim, they remain
~~engulfed in the mercy (of allaah), and when they sit with him the mercy
~~(of allaah) covers them. and whoever visits the sick muslim at the
~~beginning of the day, the angels send prayers of blessing upon him until
~~evening comes, and whoever visits him at the end of the day, the angels
~~send prayers of blessing upon him until morning comes. it is desired for
~~the person who visits the sick to supplicate for him to be cured and to
~~make him feel at ease. he should ease his worries by giving him glad
~~tidings of well-being and recovery (i.e. be positive). he should remind
~~him of repentance and turning to allaah, and he should give him
~~beneficial admonition. he should not sit with him too long (i.e. over
~~staying his welcome), rather he should only sit with him long enough
~~fulfill the right of visiting, unless the sick person is positively
~~effected by many people coming in to see him and many people coming to
~~sit with him. thus, for each situation there is a different statement
~~(i.e. advice on how to deal with it). the sixth right: his statement,
~~"and if they die, follow them (his/her funeral)." for verily whoever
~~follows the funeral until the deceased's body is prayed over, then he
~~will receive a qeeraat of reward. PageV02P0151
# (translator's note: a qeeraat is an amount *****alent to the size of
~~the mountain of uhud in madinah.) and if he follows the funeral
~~procession until the body is buried, then he will receive two qeeraats
~~of reward. and following the funeral procession contains (fulfillment
~~of) a right for allaah, a right for the deceased, and a right for the
~~living relatives of the deceased.ash-shaikh 'abdur-rahmaan bin naasir

~~الأصدقاء choosing your friends PageV02P0157
# choosing your friends humans have always been social creatures and in
~~need of friends and companions. a good part of our lives is spent in
~~interaction with others. for muslims like us who are living in a society
~~where we are clearly a minority, the issue of choosing the right
~~companions is essential for preserving our deen. befriending righteous
~~and virtuous muslims is a necessary means for staying on the straight
~~path. in an authentic hadith, the prophet muhammad (peace be upon him)
~~said: "a person is likely to follow the faith of his friend, so look
~~whom you befriend." [reported by abu dawood & tirmidhee]. mixing with
~~followers of any way other than that of the guidance results in a change
~~in one's behaviour, morals and conduct. if we accompany such friends,
~~then we inherit their habits, behaviour and perhaps even their religion.
~~such a muslim would find himself in a situation where he is willing to
~~hide his or her islam in front of those who despise it (those whom he
~~considers as friends) and to separate from the believers. when this
~~situation occurs, a point is reached when there is a very slight
~~difference between the muslim and his wrong-doing companion. many times
~~a muslim is encouraged by his friends to do evil and to forget his
~~duties. the result is that muslims themselves are often ashamed to leave
~~them to perform prayer, their friends thus causing them to clearly
~~deviate from the right path. instead of making friends with the
~~misguided ones we should befriend the righteous but still treat everyone
~~else in a gracious and just manner. PageV02P0158
# in another hadith, prophet muhammad (peace be upon him) said: "the
~~example of a good companion and a bad companion is like that of the
~~seller of musk, and the one who blows the blacksmith's bellows
~~(respectively). so as for the seller of musk then either he will grant
~~you some, or you buy some from him, or at least you enjoy a pleasant
~~smell from him. as for the one who blows the blacksmith's bellows then
~~either he will burn your clothes or you will get an offensive smell from
~~him." [bukhari & muslim] in his commentary of this hadith, imam an-
~~nawawi said that the prophet (peace be upon him) compared a good
~~companion to a seller of musk and spoke of the virtue of having
~~companions who are good, who have noble manners, piety, knowledge and
~~good culture. such are those who grant us from their virtue. and he
~~(peace be upon him) forbade us to sit with those who do evil, commit a
~~lot of sins and other bad deeds, as well as with innovators, backbiters,
~~and so forth. another scholar said: "keeping good company with the pious
~~results in attainment of beneficial knowledge, noble manners and
~~righteous actions, whereas keeping company with the wicked prevents all
~~of that." allah the exalted says in the qur'an: "and (remember) the day
~~when the wrong-doer will bite his hands and say: woe to me! would that i
~~had taken a path with the messenger. woe to me! if only i had not taken
~~so- and-so as a friend! he has led me astray from this reminder (the
~~qur'an) after it had come to me." [25:27-29]. he also says: "friends on
~~that day will be enemies one to another, except al-muttaqoon (i.e.
~~PageV02P0159
# those who have taqwah)." [43:67] in two authentic narrations of the
~~prophet (peace be upon him) we were commanded to keep company with a
~~believer only, and told that a person will be with those he loves. so if
~~we love and associate ourselves with those who are misguided, we should
~~fear for our fate. the wise person is the one who prepares himself for
~~the hereafter, not the one who neglects his faith and falls into the
~~trap of satan who tells him that he will be forgiven and that he can do
~~whatever he wishes. if we truly believe that the best speech is the
~~speech of allah and that the best guidance is the guidance of prophet
~~muhammad (peace be upon him), we should act in accordance with them,
~~lest we build a proof against ourselves. from another perspective, a
~~“believer is the mirror of his brother,” and if he sees any faults in
~~the other believer, he draws his attention to it in an acceptable
~~manner, helps him to give it up and to wipe away any evil that he may
~~have. we ask allah to make us of the righteous ones and give us
~~companions who will take us away from his wrath and lead us to his
~~pleasure and paradise. source

~~الإنفجار الأعظم للكون 18- the big bang the big bang PageV02P0160
# in the holy quran we read: "haven't the unbelievers seen that the
~~heavens and the earth were joined together (in one singularity), then we
~~clove both of them asunder.” (21:30) this verse reflects the unity of
~~creation as a dominating factor in the orderly form of the universe
~~throughout its evolutionary history from one stage to another. however,
~~long before discovering the established phenomenon of the red shift, and
~~its logical consequence of describing our universe as an expanding one,
~~scientists used einstein's theory of general relativity to extrapolate
~~back in time and came to the striking conclusion that the universe had
~~actually emerged from a single, unbelievably small, dense, hot region
~~(the hot big bang model of the universe). formation of the universe in
~~1948, george gamow modified lemaitre's hypothesis into the "big bang
~~theory" of the origin of the universe. in this theory, gamow proposed
~~that the universe was created in a gigantic explosion, whereby the
~~various elements observed today were produced within the first few
~~minutes after the big bang, as the extremely high temperature and
~~density of the universe would fuse subatomic particles into the chemical
~~elements. more recent calculations indicate that hydrogen and helium
~~were the primary products of the big bang, with heavier elements being
~~produced later within stars. the extremely high density within the
~~"primeval atom" would cause the universe to expand rapidly. PageV02P0161
# as it expanded, the smoky cloud of hydrogen and helium thus formed
~~would cool and condense into nebulae stars, galaxies, clusters, super
~~clusters, black holes, etc. this explains the original singularity of
~~the universe; its explosion to a huge cloud of smoke from which the
~~different heavenly bodies were formed by separation into eddies of
~~various masses followed by condensation. the condensed bodies were
~~arranged into stellar systems, clusters, galaxies, supergalaxies, etc.,
~~and the formed galaxies started to drift away from each other, causing
~~the steady expansion of the universe. the glorious quran describes these
~~three successive stages in the verses (21: 30), (41: 11) and (21: 104).
~~the first and the third of these verses are discussed above, while the
~~second reads: "then he (allah) turned to the sky while it was smoke, and
~~ordered it the earth to come into being willingly or unwillingly, they
~~answered: we do come in willing obedience*" (41: 11) 19- كيف نشأت فكرة
~~النشوء والتطور 19- how did the error of the evolution of religions come
~~about? how did the error of the evolution of religions come about?
~~PageV02P0162
# the common feature of all these evolutionary theories is that they are
~~opposed to belief in god. this is the philosophical basis of the
~~mistaken idea of the evolution of religion. according to the false
~~claims of herbert spencer, a leading proponent of this error, primitive
~~human beings had no religion. the first religions supposedly began with
~~the worship of the dead. other anthropologists that support the
~~deception of the evolution of religion propose different accounts. some
~~say that religion has its source in animism (the attribution of life and
~~spirit to nature); others think that religion came from totemism (the
~~worship of a symbolic person, group or object). another anthropologist,
~~e.b. taylor, believes that religion developed through history from
~~animism (the attribution of life to nature), to manism (ancestor-
~~worship), polytheism (the belief in many gods) and ending in monotheism
~~(the belief in one god). this theory was put forward in the 19th century
~~by atheist anthropologists and, presented in various scenarios, it has
~~been kept alive every since. but it is nothing more than a deception. as
~~archeological and historical evidence has shown, contrary to what these
~~scientists have proposed, there was from earliest times a monotheist
~~religion that god revealed to humanity through his prophets. but at the
~~same time there have always been deviant, superstitious beliefs
~~coexisting with monotheism. PageV02P0163
# just as today there are people who believe that god is the one and
~~only deity and lead their lives according to the religion he has
~~revealed, there are also those who are in error, worshipping idols of
~~wood and stone, satan, ancestors as well as various spirits, animals,
~~the sun, the moon and the stars. and many of these people are not
~~backward; on the contrary they are very advanced. there have also been
~~those throughout history who have not obeyed the precepts of the
~~monotheist religions revealed by god and tried to eliminate moral
~~values. the qur’an tells us of various individuals who wanted to include
~~superstitious beliefs and practices in religion and ended up altering
~~and destroying the true religion revealed to them. woe to those who
~~write the book with their own hands and then say “this is from god” to
~~sell it for a paltry price. woe to them for what their hands have
~~written! woe to them for what they earn! (qur’an, 2:79) this is the
~~reason why some people who believed in the existence and unity of god
~~and obeyed his commands abandoned true religion in the course of time
~~and espoused deviant beliefs and practices. in this way, deviant beliefs
~~and practices came into being. in other words, contrary to what some
~~have proposed, there has never been a process of religious evolution;
~~but true religion was at certain times distorted an replaced by deviant
~~religions. 20- لا يوجد عصر حجري أبدا 20- there never was a stone age

# when the findings are examined as a whole it can be seen that, with

~~used to make such perfectly regular holes in such hard stones.

~~copper awl dating back to around 10,000 bc is evidence that mines and
~~****ls were known about and used in the period in question. copper ore,
~~found in crystal or powder form, appears in seam form in old, hard
~~rocks. a society that made a copper awl must have recognized copper ore,
~~managed to extract it from inside the rock and have had the
~~technological means with which to work it. this shows that they had not
~~just stopped being primitive, as evolutionists maintain. PageV02P0166
# http://www.thestoneage.org/res/110.jpg 9-10,000-year-old needles and
~~awl these needles and awl, which go back to around 7-8000 bc, are
~~important evidence of the cultural lives of the people of the time.
~~people who use awls and needles clearly led fully human lives, and not
~~animal ones as evolutionists maintain.
~~http://www.thestoneage.org/res/116.jpg this stone carving is 11,000
~~years old. according to evolutionists, only crude, stone tools were in
~~use at that time. the fact is, however, that such a work cannot be
~~produced by rubbing one stone against another. evolutionists can offer
~~no rational and logical explanation of how the relief in question was
~~formed and made so accurately. intelligent human beings using tools made
~~out of iron or steel are necessary in order to be able to produce this
~~and other similar works. of course, throughout history, there have of
~~course always been those living under simpler, more primitive conditions
~~as well as societies living civilized lives. but this by no means
~~constitutes evidence for the so-called evolution of history. because
~~while one part of the world is launching shuttles into space, people in
~~other lands are still unacquainted with electricity. yet this does not
~~mean that those who build spacecraft are mentally or physically more
~~advanced—and have progressed further down the supposed evolutionary road
~~and become more culturally evolved—nor that the others are closer to
~~their “ancestral” ape-men. these merely indicate differences in cultures
~~and civilizations. PageV02P0167
# over the course of history, of course, major advances have been made
~~in all fields, with great strides and constant development in science
~~and technology, thanks to the accumulation of culture and experience.
~~however, it is neither rational nor scientific to describe these changes
~~as an “evolutionary” process in the way that evolutionists and
~~materialists do. just as there are no differences in physical
~~characteristics between a modern human and someone who lived thousands
~~of years ago, so there are no differences in regard to intelligence and
~~capabilities. the idea that our civilization is more advanced because
~~21st century man’s brain capacity and intelligence are more highly
~~developed is a faulty perspective, resulting from evolutionist
~~indoctrination. the fact is people in very different regions today may
~~have different conceptions and cultures. but if a native australian may
~~not possess the same knowledge as a scientist from the usa, that doesn’t
~~mean his intelligence or brain haven’t developed enough. many people
~~born into such societies may even be ignorant of the existence of
~~electricity, but who are still highly intelligent. 21- العلمانية والقيم
~~الأخلاقية 21- secularism and moral values secularism and moral values
~~PageV02P0168
# by dr. ja`far sheikh idris moral values, such as honesty,
~~trustworthiness, justice and chastity, are originally innate values
~~which allâh planted in the hearts of mankind; then he sent his
~~messengers with a system of life in accord with this innate disposition
~~to affirm it. "so set your face toward the religion, as one by nature
~~upright; the instinctive (religion) which allâh has created in mankind.
~~there is no altering (the laws) of allâh 's creation. that is the right
~~religion but most people do not know." [surat al-rûm:30]. a believer
~~adheres to these moral values because his nature, fortified by faith,
~~induces him to do so, and because the religion he believes in commands
~~him with them and promises him a reward for them in the hereafter.
~~secularism, on the other hand, even in its less virulent form that
~~satisfies itself with removing religion from political life, rejecting
~~it and the innate values as a basis for legislation, undermines the two
~~foundations for moral values in the hearts of mankind. as for secularism
~~in its extreme atheistic form, it completely demolishes these two
~~foundations and replaces them with human whims, either the whims of a
~~few rulers in dictatorial systems or the whims of the majority in
~~democratic systems. "have you seen the one who has taken his own desire
~~as his god? would you then be a guardian over him?" [al-furqân:43].
~~since whims and desires are by their nature constantly changing, the
~~values and behaviours based on them are also mutable. PageV02P0169
# what is considered today to be a crime, punishable by law with the
~~severest of penalties, and causes its practitioners to be deprived of
~~certain rights granted to others, becomes permissible tomorrow, or even
~~praiseworthy, and the one who objects to it becomes " politically
~~incorrect." this shift from one point of view to its opposite, as a
~~result of society's estrangement from innate religious values, is a
~~frequent occurrence. however ignorant a traditional society may be, it,
~~or many of its members, will maintain some innate values; but the
~~further a society penetrates into secularism, the fewer such individuals
~~will become, and the more marginal their influence will be, until the
~~society collectively rebels against those same innate religious values
~~it used to uphold. there may be another reason for some traditional
~~jâhili cultures to maintain innate religious values: they might appeal
~~to their desires, or they represent their heritage and do not conflict
~~with their desires. "and when they are called to allâh and his messenger
~~to judge between them, lo! a party of them refuse and turn away. but if
~~the right is with them they come to him willingly." [al-nûr: 48-49].
~~their relationship with truth is similar to satan's, as described by the
~~prophet (sallallâh u alayhe wa sallam) to abu hurairah, whom satan had
~~advised to recite ayâât al-kursi when going to bed: "he told you the
~~truth, even though he is an inveterate liar." contemporary western,
~~secular societies are the clearest examples of the shifting, self-
~~contradictory nature of jâhili civilization. PageV02P0170
# from one angle it views culture and the values it rests upon as a
~~relative, variable phenomenon. however, from another angle it
~~characterises some values as human values, views their violation as
~~shocking, and punishes their violators severely. the sources of this
~~problem are two fundamental principles which democratic secular
~~societies rely upon. the first is majority rule as a standard for right
~~and wrong in speech and behaviour; the second is the principle of
~~individual freedom. these two principles will necessarily conflict with
~~each other if they are not subordinated to another principle that will
~~judge between them. secularism, by its very nature, rejects religion,
~~and in its western form it does not consider fitrah (innate values) a
~~criterion for what is beneficial or harmful for humanity. it has no
~~alternative but to make these two principles an absolute standard for
~~what behaviour is permissible and appropriate, and what isn't. the
~~contradiction and conflict between these two principles is showing
~~itself plainly in some of the current hot issues in these societies.
~~those who advocate the acceptance of homosexuality and the granting to
~~avowed homosexuals equal rights and opportunities in every aspect of
~~life, including military service, base their argument on the principle
~~of individual rights. they see no one as having the right to concern
~~themselves with what they call their " sexual orientation." the same
~~argument is made by supporters of abortion. PageV02P0171
# you frequently hear them say incredulously, "how can i be prohibited
~~from freedom of choice in my own affairs and over my own body? what
~~right do legal authorities have to involve themselves in such personal
~~matters?" the only argument their opponents can muster is that this
~~behaviour contradicts the values held by the majority of the population.
~~even though the basis for many people's opposition to abortion is moral
~~or religious, they can't come out and say so openly, nor can they employ
~~religious or moral arguments, since secular society finds neither of
~~them acceptable. if we accept that there is no basis for values except
~~individual or majority opinion, and that it is therefore possible for
~~all values to change from one era to another, and from one society to
~~another, this means there is no connection between values and what will
~~benefit or harm people in their material and spiritual lives, which in
~~turn means that all values are equality valid and it doesn't matter
~~which values a given society accepts or rejects. however, this means
~~that all behaviour considered abhorrent by secular societies today, such
~~as sexual molestation of children and rape of women for which it has
~~serious penalties, are considered repulsive only because of current
~~inclination, which might change tomorrow, so certain serious crimes may
~~become acceptable, based on the principle of individual freedom.
~~PageV02P0172
# the reason a secularist is confused when posed with certain questions
~~is that his repugnance toward such crimes is not really based on these
~~two principles, which have become the only accepted bases for argument
~~in societies dominated by secularism; the real reason for it is the
~~remnants of the moral feelings he still possesses from the original
~~nature with which allâh endowed him, and which linger on in spite of his
~~secularism. perhaps the confusion of the secularist would increase if he
~~were asked for what reason he had given such precedence to these
~~democratic values, until he made them the standard by which all other
~~values and behaviours are judged. if he says his reverence for them is
~~based merely on current personal preference and inclination, or on
~~cultural chauvinism, he will have no reply to one who opposes him on the
~~basis of his contradictory personal preferences, or because the norms of
~~his society differ from those of the other. the flimsy foundation of
~~values in secular societies makes them liable to turn at any time
~~against all the values they currently hold dear. it also paves the way
~~for them to descend to their practices of the occupation and
~~colonisation of weaker nations. there is nothing to make them refrain
~~from doing so, once one of them stands up and announces that there is a
~~nationalist benefit to be gained by it and a large number of fellow
~~citizens believe him. his policy proposal becomes official policy, based
~~on the standard of majority approval. it is, however, as you can see, an
~~approval based on nothing more than greed. PageV02P0173
# this has been the justification for every transgression in history. in
~~fact it is the basis on which any animal attacks another. personal
~~freedom and majority rule are not, then, the fundamental values on which
~~secular culture is based. that is because freedom entails choice, but it
~~is not the criterion for that choice. i mean that whoever is given the
~~freedom to choose needs a standard that he can use as the criterion for
~~his choice. likewise, majority opinion is not itself the standard; it is
~~merely the result of many individual choices made on the basis of some
~~standard. so what is the basis for the choices of a free individual and
~~a free society in the secular system? it is, without the slightest
~~doubt, those whims and desires which have taken the place of the real
~~deity. 22- الإسلام وطبيعة الكون 22- islam and the nature of the
~~universe islam and the nature of the universe PageV02P0174
# it is god who raised the skies without support, as you can see, then
~~assumed his throne, and enthralled the sun and the moon (so that) each
~~runs to a predetermined course. he disposes all affairs, distinctly
~~explaining every sign that you may be certain of the meeting with your
~~lord] (ar-ra`d 13:2) the last of the abrahamic religions, following
~~judaism and christianity, islam considers the creation of the universe
~~as ultimate proof of the existence of one creator who “is that dimension
~~which makes other dimensions possible; he gives meaning and life to
~~everything” (rahman) according to the teachings of islam, allah (god) is
~~the one and only god, the absolute creator of the universe, its
~~components and its laws. allah is the beginning and the end of all
~~things, and this is the foundation for islam’s teachings. the qur’an is
~~the word of allah as passed down to muslims through the prophet muhammad
~~(peace be upon him) and the existence of only one version of the qur’an
~~(there are no dissimilarities between any two copies) attests to the
~~reverence in which muslims hold it. for muslims, the qur’an, containing
~~the word of allah, provides irrefutable proof of his existence. along
~~with the qur’an, nature provides another source for the proof of allah’s
~~existence. this intimate relationship between the qur’an and nature is
~~shown in the phrase ayat, which refers to signs of allah’s existence in
~~nature and also refers to the verses in the qur’an. ============= the
~~creation ============= in islam, the world as man knows it, begins and
~~ends with allah. PageV02P0175
# unlike christianity and judaism, the creation process is not described
~~in detail, but referred to as a starting point for allah’s power. the
~~creation story in islam is described in the qur’an as the creation of
~~the universe by allah’s will with a single command: “be!” several verses
~~in the qur’an highlight allah’s power of creation: [creator of the
~~heavens and the earth from nothingness, he has only to say when he wills
~~a thing: “be,” and it is] (al-baqarah 2:117) and, [that is how god
~~creates what he wills, when he decrees a thing, he says “be,” and it is]
~~(aal `imran 3:47). man’s relationship with nature materialises in
~~islamic living in several ways, the most significant and obvious being
~~death in this manner, allah created the heavens and the earth, the sun
~~and the moon, and the rest of the universe. he created the plants and
~~the animals, and placed them on earth, and he decreed upon them the laws
~~by which the natural order of all creation functions. the universe is an
~~independent entity, it exists according to those laws and does not
~~require (divine) intervention, yet it cannot “warrant for its own
~~existence and it cannot explain itself” (rahman). in islam, this in
~~itself is considered conclusive proof of allah’s existence. the laws
~~placed by allah take into account all natural phenomena and provide
~~further proof for allah’s greatness, which the qur’an describes in
~~detail. [he ushers in the dawn, and made the night for rest, the sun and
~~moon a computation. such is the measure appointed by him, the omnipotent
~~and all-wise] (al-an`am 6:96). PageV02P0176
# natural law, as decreed by allah, “reflects and issues from the order
~~that exists in the divine realm” (nasr) where allah exists.
~~============== mankind & nature ============== islam invites man to
~~discover the laws of nature and the ways in which the universe exists.
~~man was created from clay, and is thus part of nature, not separate from
~~it. this relationship with nature materialises in islamic living in
~~several ways, the most significant and obvious being death. muslim
~~burials require the corpse to be washed, have all items removed, and
~~placed in the ground within three days—for an easier return to the earth
~~whence it came. within allah’s universe, man was given a special place.
~~in islamic teachings, in contrast to those of christianity, man was not
~~made in god’s image. rather, allah distinguished man from his other
~~creations by breathing his own spirit into man. this preferential
~~treatment of god’s creation gave man two privileges not made available
~~to the rest of creation: (1) freedom of choice and (2) specialised
~~knowledge or “creative knowledge” (rahman). freedom of choice allows man
~~the ability to make the decision whether or not to worship allah and
~~follow his will. the universe, as described before, is governed by the
~~laws decreed for it by allah, and has, therefore, been in submission to
~~allah since its creation. man, however, was given the ability to think,
~~rationalize, and argue the presence of a creator, and then decide
~~whether to submit to him or not. PageV02P0177
# ======================== an open invitation to knowledge and learning
~~======================= creative knowledge was first displayed—according
~~to the teachings of islam—when, after the angels questioned allah as to
~~why he had created man in the form of adam, allah challenged the angels
~~and adam to name objects. the angels were unable to bestow names upon
~~things, whereas adam could, giving him superiority over those that he
~~had named and demonstrating his creator’s power. ==================
~~islam is a natural religion. ================== as part of man’s
~~privilege, islam, through the qur’an, invites man to discover the laws
~~of nature and the ways in which the universe exists. there is no threat
~~to allah’s supremacy in this way, because if allah wills something to
~~remain a mystery (such as himself) then man has no possible way of
~~discovering whatever allah chooses to remain hidden. on the contrary,
~~when man sees for himself the extent to which the universe has been
~~meticulously planned and provided for, allah’s infinite wisdom becomes
~~apparent. man is invited to question, discover, explore, and manipulate
~~the world around him and use it for his benefit. there are three types
~~of learning encouraged in islam, all of which will (or should)
~~inevitably lead to acknowledgement and recognition of allah’s power.
~~these are: (1) the discovery of nature, its laws, and how it can be used
~~for the benefit of mankind; (2) the exploration of the history and the
~~geography of the physical world and its peoples; and (3) knowledge of
~~oneself (rahman). PageV02P0178
# this encouragement to learn and discover has led to a proliferation of
~~arab scholars in the fields of the natural sciences and mathematics. in
~~islamic philosophy, one must always seek knowledge, both within and
~~without, as knowledge illuminates the path on which one must travel.
~~ignorance is an unfavourable state of being, as the process pf
~~acknowledging the existence and power of allah is one of enlightenment
~~through knowing. “nature exists for man to exploit for his own ends,
~~while the end of man himself is nothing else but to serve god, to be
~~grateful to him, and to worship him alone” (rahman). islam suggests that
~~nature was created by allah specifically for mankind’s use and so must
~~be recognised and respected as a gift for which man must be grateful.
~~there are three reasons for creation: (1) “to serve as a collection of
~~signs, or ayat, of the power and goodness of allah”; (2) “to serve allah
~~and to be submissive to god’s will”; and (3) “for the use of humans”
~~(timm). natural law in islam is based on the laws allah created for
~~nature, which as mentioned earlier, reflected the laws of allah’s divine
~~realm. man is expected to discover allah’s will and to follow it,
~~because “islam suggests that discovering the truth, learning the truth,
~~and believing in the truth are all possible” (ezzati). allah created the
~~universe, bestowed human beings with a privileged position within it,
~~and left the world to function under the laws he had decreed for it.
~~PageV02P0179
# allah observes how people treat the bounty he has given them, and the
~~universe is allowed to exist, with little intervention, for a certain
~~length of time. at the end of this time, following portents of the end
~~of the world as we know it, mankind is brought in front of allah for
~~judgment day. islam’s eschatology places allah’s role as mankind’s judge
~~as the progression from his role as mankind’s creator, and man will be
~~punished or rewarded for his deeds in allah’s universe. islam is a
~~natural religion, in that its teachings advocate the utilisation of
~~nature for man’s benefit, along with the preservation of the universe
~~that allah has placed in mankind’s safekeeping. ========== references:

# abu cuyler -----------------------------------------------------------
~~--------------------- i bear witness that there is no god but allah, and
~~muhammad is his messenger. peace and blessings be upon you all. my story
~~of how i reverted back to islam is quite interesting. i am actually 24
~~years old now, going on 25. i took my shahada 8 years ago when i was a
~~junior/senior in high school('91) ma sha'allah. my parents are both
~~christians, my father is a practicing baptist, and my mother is a non-
~~practicing catholic. my mother wanted my brother and i to be raised so
~~that we can make our own choice when it comes to spirituality. my father
~~wanted us to be raised baptist. however, my parents divorced when i was
~~very young(age 3 or so), and we lived with our mother. i can remember
~~going to church with my father, but all i remember from it was trying to
~~stay awake. it was boring and uninteresting to me, to the point where i
~~disliked going. the last time i went to church with my father was around
~~age 12. as i grew a little older and gained more knowledge about my
~~people's history in this country and how religion has played a part, i
~~began to not only dislike christianity, but despise it. with el hajj
~~malik shabazz being a great mentor and role model for me, i began to
~~question why it is that our people are still in the same conditions when
~~we are known for being a very spiritual people. my conclusion was that
~~the religion of christianity(as being practiced in recent history and
~~present) did not work. somehow god was not listening to christians.
~~PageV02P0187
# i also began to associate christianity as being a slaves religion.
~~back in 1990 i stopped eating pork because i felt a force coming towards
~~me, and i also knew it was not fit for anyone to eat. i didn't know for
~~sure what was happening but during the next year after i stopped eating
~~swine, i began to see signs of islam. being a rap video fan, various rap
~~videos by people in the nation of islam started appearing. i saw them as
~~signs. back then i did not know the difference between the nation of
~~islam and islam. they were all the same to me. also, my cousin had
~~become muslim, and she had given me several pamphlets on the life of the
~~prophet(s.a.w.), and islam alhamdullilah. she wore hijab and basically
~~was my resource for any questions, concerns, or events going on. she was
~~the only muslim i knew or had ever been in contact with (outside of
~~farrakhan video tapes), and provided a great example of a muslim through
~~her actions. one of my other concerns with christianity was why i had to
~~pray through a middle-man? why did i have to pray to a man? i believe in
~~god almighty. i also didn't know how to pray to god. islam provided
~~answers to all of my questions on how to be a worthy servant of god.
~~islam taught me how to live, and how to pray. my first visit to the
~~masjid was very powerful. islam gave me a since of community and peace
~~immediately although i hadn't accepted it yet. it was more realistic to
~~me to pray to god everyday, rather than just thinking about god on
~~sunday. a way of life, as opposed to just a religion. those brothers and
~~sisters treated me like family. PageV02P0188

~~maryam al-mahdayah maryam al-mahdayah reverting to islam: a journey back
~~to god by maryam al-mahdayah (usa/egypt) (received 08/24/98) al-salamu
~~alaykum, my name is maryam al-mahdayah - i was not born with this name,
~~but chose it when i converted to islam (in 1992). my christian birth
~~name is maria (mary in english, maryam in arabic). i would like to share
~~with you my personal story of converting to islam, with the hope that
~~this story might bring with it a better understanding of islam. my story
~~is organized into different life-periods: growing up christian (early
~~years) turning away (teen years) searching for truth (the twenties) the
~~opening (the thirties) coming home (the forties and forever) growing up
~~christian -- early years i was raised in the catholic tradition. i went
~~to catholic elementary school, learned my cathechism, received my first
~~communion, received my catholic name (after a saint), went to
~~confession, all the important steps to growing up catholic. i tried my
~~best to be good, and i was (i was too afraid of some terrible
~~retribution from god if i wasn't) and throughout these years i developed
~~a substantial feeling of guilt (for what, i wasn't sure, but i knew i
~~was guilty of something). the nuns who taught me seemed harsh, and i
~~couldn't understand why these 'brides of christ' were so tense and
~~angry. in the summers i would travel south to visit my mother's family -
~~my grandfather was at one time a baptist minister, and my mother was
~~raised in the baptist tradition. PageV02P0189
# (because my father was catholic she had to convert to catholicism in
~~order to marry him). so, when i went south, i went to church and bible
~~school, and sang christian songs around the antique organ - my aunt
~~would play, and my cousin and i would sing with great feeling. these
~~were good times, and this part of my christian upbringing was more
~~enjoyable and comfortable. and so the years passed. i spent the school
~~year at home, and summers in the south. my religious life was much of a
~~double life. looking back, it seems that the only thing the catholic and
~~baptist traditions had in common was a foundation in jesus (peace be
~~upon him). beyond that, they were two different worlds for me. turning
~~away -- teen years i didn't have an easy childhood, and the family
~~problems grew in severity to the point where one day, i came to the
~~conclusion that there is no god (or, at the very least, if there was a
~~god, he wasn't there for me). i remember that day, laying in my bed at
~~night, waking up to that reality. i suddenly felt a great vacuum within
~~myself, but, i told myself, if that's reality, then i have to accept it.
~~at my level of understanding, that was my reality. as my teen years
~~progressed, i started searching. by this time, i was no longer required
~~to go to church (in our family religious practice was non-existent by
~~then), so i decided to seek the truth myself. i remember reading about
~~jesus (pbuh). i had a very strong feeling about him, and even felt
~~connected to him in some way. PageV02P0190
# but i could never accept his manner of death (how could someone so
~~special and close to god die like that???). that seemed a tragedy beyond
~~de******ion. and so i developed my own opinion and belief that jesus
~~(pbuh) was in fact a real person, did in fact live on this earth, was in
~~fact a very special person with a very special mission, but beyond that,
~~i didn't know. eventually i gave up on the idea of christianity
~~entirely, because too many things didn't make sense. searching for truth
~~-- twenties as i entered my twenties, i felt a tremendous need to find
~~the truth, to still the restlessness in my heart and soul. i was
~~introduced to buddhism, and since it seemed to come close to what i was
~~looking for (at least there was a clear logic to it), i joined. in many
~~ways it did help me feel better, but to me it seemed to be missing
~~something (what, i didn't know at that time). over the years, i drifted
~~away from buddhism as well. it was becoming more of a burden than a
~~comfort in my life. during this time i traveled to egypt for business,
~~where i met my husband, who was raised in the muslim tradition. still
~~involved in buddhism, i tried to convert him. he patiently listened, and
~~i believed i was succeeding, but i know now that he would never have
~~converted. the opening -- thirties so i continued, became more
~~uncomfortable with buddhist practice, went back to egypt to get married,
~~came back to the usa alone and eventually returned to egypt to live with
~~my husband. we were there together for a year, a wondrous, healing and
~~unforgettable year. by now i was in my early thirties. PageV02P0191
# i had just arrived in egypt to really start married life, stressed out
~~to my limit, feeling very much that i had arrived with my last breath. i
~~had been separated from my husband for over a year (my job kept me in
~~the usa, other concerns kept him in egypt). we kept in touch all during
~~this time, but it was so difficult and stressful that i lost a great
~~deal of weight. i was described as looking anorexic. i wasn't aware of
~~this until one day i happened to see myself in the rearview mirror of a
~~taxi. i saw my neck, with bones extending. at first i didn't realize
~~that was me - when i did, it was quite a shock. i looked at myself with
~~new eyes - my hands were bony - i was beginning to look like a living
~~skeleton. during this time my husband was talking to me - quietly,
~~patiently - explaining not about islam, but about believing in god. he
~~told me that it didn't matter which religion i chose to practice, as
~~long as i believed in god. i argued with him over and over that there
~~was no god (and buddhism supported this belief) and over and over he
~~explained that there is a god and gave me details of the signs of god,
~~the qualities of god. he explained how god is very much with me, and
~~talked to me about god from the perspective of islam, emphasizing
~~throughout that i did not have to be muslim - just believe in god. being
~~a stubborn person, i still resisted outwardly, but inwardly, a small
~~****** of hope began to open.... my husband asked a friend to bring me
~~some books about islam. PageV02P0192
# i was surprised he would do so, because i was still "not interested in
~~hearing about god" - sometimes emphatically so. so he left me with the
~~books: an english translation of the qur'an, a book about all facets of
~~islam and a book from the sufi perspective. my interest was slightly
~~piqued, but i dismissed it. i put the books aside, and later went to
~~bed. that night, i had a dream. in this dream, i was somewhere,
~~surrounded by glorious white light. in the background, i heard beautiful
~~music that sounded like qur'anic reading. i saw the face of a sheikh,
~~wearing a white hat with a red band. behind me was a golden, spiralling
~~staircase. all these images were suspended in this wondrous white light.
~~this light was brighter that anything i had seen in waking life, but the
~~brightness didn't hurt my eyes. it was pure, heavenly whiteness. then i
~~looked down, and became aware that i was covered all in white, in the
~~muslim fashion. beautiful white flowing dress and head covering. all the
~~while, i kept feeling a tremendous joy pouring out from inside me, and i
~~was filled with this same white light from within. in front of me to my
~~left was a child, about 5 or 6 years old, facing forward so i could not
~~see the face. i didn't know if it was a boy or girl, but i knew this was
~~my child. (at the time, i was physically unable to have children). this
~~dream had a profound impact on me. although it was 7 years ago, i can
~~still remember it vividly in detail. when i awoke, i related this dream.
~~PageV02P0193
# not knowing its significance, i told my husband about it because it
~~was so vivid in my mind and didn't make sense to me. i had never had
~~this kind of dream before. when i finished telling it, my husband said,
~~"this is the kind of dream every muslim wishes to have". but why me? i
~~didn't believe in god, denied his existence (passionately at times), and
~~had no interest in islam or becoming muslim. he explained that god was
~~telling me something in this dream and i was very lucky. he also told me
~~that god was close to me. that surprised me. (interestingly, this dream
~~did not have a dreamlike quality, but in fact gave me the feeling that i
~~was looking at things to come.) after this dream, i decided to open the
~~books about islam, and find out more about this religion... coming home
~~-- forties and forever i read about the principles of islam. they made
~~sense to me, with no contradiction. the de******ions of the islamic way
~~of life, the roles of men and women in society as complimentary rather
~~than competitive were so logical. after reading this i understood that
~~what i felt instinctively about myself as a woman was, in fact, true to
~~my real nature. rather than feeling demeaned, i felt uplifted, not only
~~as a woman, but as a member of the human race. i started to feel my true
~~self, for the first time in my life. i began to have the sense that i
~~was coming home. i read the qur'an. although not in the arabic original,
~~i found that just reading the verses in english filled me with a
~~tremendous sense of peace and quiet, in a most gentle way. PageV02P0194
# the verses themselves answered many questions i had throughout my
~~life, but could never get a clear answer to. reading the qur'an, i began
~~to realize that this book must be the work and the word of god, because
~~of its impeccable logic and its effect on me. i learned that this is one
~~of the qualities of the qur'an, a certain "barakah" or grace that has a
~~very calming effect on the human soul. shortly afterward, i had surgery
~~with the hope that i may be able to have a child. the surgery went well,
~~but my chances for having a child were still slim to none. by this time
~~i was reading the qur'an regularly and trying to learn more about islam.
~~i asked questions constantly and immersed myself in the atomosphere of
~~islam - i loved hearing the daily prayer calls on every street and one
~~day asked my husband to take me to al-azhar, world-renowned center for
~~islamic learning, to visit the mosque. i had seen this mosque on tv and
~~felt curiously drawn to it. so one day we went. it was quiet; i walked
~~around, read the qur'an, sat quietly for a while. it was a nice peaceful
~~time, and we left. about halfway down the street, i stopped and looked
~~down - i wanted to make sure my feet were touching the ground, because i
~~couldn't feel the sidewalk underneath my footsteps. i truly felt i was
~~walking on air....this is the effect of islam on me - the feeling of
~~lightness was translated literally. i had so many unusual experiences
~~during this time, many just momentary things, that i truly began to
~~believe in my heart that god was, indeed, with me and close to me.
~~PageV02P0195
# the best of all in the human sense was that the following year we had
~~a beautiful daughter - truly a gift from god. even the doctor who had
~~performed the surgery was amazed. this was the first time ever for her
~~to do this kind of surgery, and she had no way of predicting the
~~outcome, except that the chances were small. (god was with me even
~~then). we moved to the usa and our daughter was born in the autumn, 4
~~months after our arrival. the following year we went back to egypt so my
~~husband's family could meet this wonderful addition to our family.
~~before we left, i decided it was time to officially become muslim - god
~~had shown me so many signs, that i knew this was the clear path for me.
~~and so, back in egypt, i went to al-azhar to declare, "there is no god
~~but god, and muhammad is his messenger." now i'm in my forties and
~~looking back through my life, particularly the last 10 years, i see the
~~hand of god in all the hundreds of incidents and events along the way.
~~as one always searching for the truth, whether good or bad, i have
~~found, through personal experience, that god is the one reality. we need
~~only to open our eyes, ears and hearts to recognize the truth:
~~[bismillah al-rahman al-rahim] " we shall show them our signs in the
~~horizons and in themselves, till it is clear to them that it is the
~~truth. PageV02P0196
# suffices it not as to thy lord, that he is witness over everything?
~~are they not in doubt touching the encounter with their lord? does he
~~not encompass everything?" [sadaqa allahu alazim] (qur'an xli:53-54 /
~~distinguished) discovering islam has been like discovering treasure - a
~~treasure of unlimited value. because of islam i have found myself.
~~through concrete experience i have found that god does exist; that he is
~~kind, loving, merciful and ever-watchful over me. i have found clarity,
~~meaning and clear direction in my life. god has given me so much,
~~including a family beyond my dreams, a family that resonates perfectly
~~with the deepest desires of my heart and soul, as only he can provide in
~~the most perfect way. i have peace of mind and spirit only when i drink
~~deeply of islam and the qur'an, a wondrous healing drink that only god
~~can provide in the most perfect way. the greatest gift from god to me is
~~that he has touched my soul and let me feel his gentleness, loving
~~kindness and mercy. by the grace of god, i am becoming al-mahdayah, the
~~rightly guided one. in order to become the best, the most productive and
~~most compassionate human beings we can be, god has sent us his final
~~message to mankind in the most perfect way - the way of islam, the way
~~of peace. my personal experience with christianity left me feeling empty
~~for so long that i could not acknowledge its value. however, islam
~~teaches us that judaism, christianity and islam all come from god, each
~~with a message sent from god, and therefore all are worthy of respect.
~~PageV02P0197
# although born into christianity, islam is the true path of my soul.
~~because i am now firmly grounded in my relationship to god, i find that
~~i can appreciate other traditions as well, from the perspective of
~~islam. there is no more conflict within, because i have come home. in
~~the name of god, the merciful, the compassionate praise belongs to god,
~~the lord of all being, the all-merciful, the all-compassionate, the
~~master of the day of doom. thee only we serve; to thee alone we pray for
~~help guide us in the straight path, the path of those whom thou hast
~~blessed, not of those against whom thou art wrathful, nor of those who
~~go astray. [sadaqa allahu alazim] (qur'an 1:1-7 / al-fatihah) source

~~PageV02P0198
# phreddie my conversion to islam by phreddie / usa (received 09/04/99)
~~i will say right away that i am very young. i am only 18, and that fact
~~seems to astound most people. i think it is proof that we are never too
~~young to begin looking for god, or to understand his truth. i was raised
~~christian, nondenominational. we were never big church goers, but we
~~always knew who our god was and what our obligation was to him. in my
~~living room, to this day. hangs a big velvet painting of jesus as a
~~black man. that left a huge imprint on me, because it made god real to
~~me. not only did he come to earth as a man, but he was black like me. in
~~my preteen years i was a crusader for christ. i wanted to convert the
~~world and save souls. i beleived blindly 100% in everything that was
~~given to me by the bible and my pastor/youth leader. then one day i ran
~~across something in the bible that didn't sound anything like the god
~~who i had learned to love and obey. i thought perhaps i was just too
~~young to understand and took it to a more knowledgable christian who
~~confirmed that it was what i thought it was. my world fell apart. i read
~~the bible, cover to cover, and marked along the way all of the things
~~that were contradictory or ungodly. by the time i got to revelations i
~~had a large segment of the bible marked as invalid. so, thinking maybe i
~~needed to look at it in a historical perspective i did my history work.
~~there i found even more hypocracy, blasphemy, and human tampering with
~~holy ******ures. PageV02P0199
# what shocked me was the story of the coucil of nice where human men
~~"divinely guided" decided which **** would be in the bible and which
~~ones needed editing. i also had to ask myself how god could be three and
~~one at the same time. what happens to a good man like ghandi when he
~~dies without jesus? does hitler get to go to heaven if he accepts christ
~~as his lord and saviour? what about those who have never been exposed to
~~christianity? i was once told that the trinity was part of the essence
~~of god and that since the breadth and scope of god is beyond my
~~understanding i should simply beleive. i couldn't worship a god i
~~couldn't understand. i never lost my faith in god, i just decided that
~~christianity was not the right path for me to travel. i felt no kinship
~~with fellow beleivers. i never felt anything special while attending
~~service except that i was doing an obligatory service to god. so i
~~wandered faithless, looking for something to hold on to. in my search i
~~found wicca, the bahai faith, and finally islam. i studied islam
~~quietly, on my own, in secret, for two years. i wanted to be able to
~~seperate fact from fiction. i did not want to confuse islam with the
~~cultures who claim to practice islam while instituting things that are
~~clearly against all that allah has revealed to us. i wanted to make the
~~distinction between the religion and the societies that adopted it. that
~~took time and patience. i met a lot of helpful brothers and sister via
~~e-mail who answered all of my questions and opened their lives up for me
~~to examine. PageV02P0200
# i never liked the image that i was handed as to what a woman was. in
~~popular culture we are portrayed as very sexy, lady like, independant
~~enough so that men ahve no real responsibility toward us or the children
~~they help create, but dependant enough that we are continually in search
~~of a new man. the average woman on the street is honked at , whistled
~~at, has had her butt or breasts pinched, slapped, rubbed, or oggled by
~~some strange woman. i never agreed with any of that and never found a
~~"come on" flattering. in christianity i was taught that as a woman i
~~should not teach in church or question the authority of any man in
~~public. the picture painted of women in christianity was one of
~~inferiority. we were supposed to be chaste and silent with children
~~about our feet. in islam i found a voice, a system that gave me ultimate
~~respect for being a mother and acknowledged the fact that i was equal to
~~man in every way except one: physical strength. the hadith are littered
~~with stories of women who spoke publically and islamic history is full
~~of women who were leaders. it was a theology that i could respect
~~because it respected me. i had to ask myself if i really wanted to be
~~like all of the people i saw around me. who was really oppressed? the
~~girl wearing skin tight jeans getting cat calls from boys rolling by in
~~cars was not free. she was society's whore and she got no respect. i was
~~thankful that my mother had never allowed me to wear such things, not
~~that i ever wanted to, but her disapproval was an added insentive.
~~PageV02P0201
# after examining the position of the muslim woman and what i felt to be
~~truth in my heart, how could i deny islam. six weeks ago i made the
~~decision to convert to islam. i did so and have not looked back since.
~~my friends respect it because they see that it has not changed who i am
~~and what i stand for, in fact it has backed it up. my advise to any
~~woman out there is to ask herself these questions: what do you want your
~~daughtor to beleive about herself? how should she allow herself to be
~~treated? is she really born with evil tendencies because she is a
~~descendant of eve? how do you want her to feel about her body? what are
~~you modeling for her? what image of womanhood are you promoting? how do
~~men treat you and how do you allow yourself to be treated? source

# sumaiya (kristin) discovering the truth sumaiya (kristin), usa
~~(received 01/25/2000) my search for a religion began in high school when
~~i was 15 or 16 yrs. old. i had been associating with a bad group of
~~people whom i thought were my friends, but in time i realized these
~~people were losers. i saw what direction their lives were heading in and
~~it wasn't a good one. i didn't want these people to have any affect on
~~my success for the future, so i cut myself off from them completely. it
~~was hard in the beginning because i was alone without friends. i started
~~to look for something to associate myself with and something that i
~~could rely on and base my life on....somehting that no person could ever
~~use to destroy my future with. naturally, i turned to seeking god.
~~finding out who god was and what the truth was wasn't easy however. what
~~was the truth anyway?! this was my primary question as i began my search
~~for a religion. in my own family there have been many shifts of
~~religion. my family has jews and a few kinds of christianity in it, and
~~now, alhumdulilah islam. when my mom and dad were married they felt the
~~need to decide what faith to bring there children up in. since the
~~catholic church was really the only option for them (our town just has
~~600 people) they both converted to catholicism and raised my sister and
~~i as catholics. going back through the stories of conversions in my own
~~family, it seems that they are all conversions of convenience. i don't
~~think they were truly seeking god, but just manipulating religion as the
~~means to achieving an end. PageV02P0203
# even after all these changes in the past, religion was never of
~~extreme importance for my mom, dad, sister or i. if anything, ours was
~~the family you saw at church during christmas time and easter. i always
~~felt that religion was something separate from my life, 6 days a week or
~~life and one day a week for church, on the rare occasions when i did go.
~~in other words, i wasn't conscious of god or how to live according to
~~his teachings on a day to day basis. i didn't accept some catholic
~~practices including: 1) confessions to a priest: i thought why couldn't
~~i just confess to god without having to go through a man to get to him?
~~2) the "perfect" pope- how can a mere man, not even a prophet, be
~~perfect?! 3) the worship of saints- wasn't this a direct violation of
~~the first commandment? even after 14 years of forced sunday school
~~attendance, the answers i received to these questions and others were,
~~"you just have to have faith!!" should i have faith because someone told
~~me to?! i thought faith should be based on the truth and answers that
~~appealed to logic, i was interested to find some. i didn't want the
~~truth of my parents, or friends, or anyone else. i wanted god's truth. i
~~wanted every idea i held to be true to me because i believed it
~~entirely, heart and soul. i decided if i was to find the answers to my
~~questions i would have to search with an objective mind and i began to
~~read... i decided that christianity was not the religion for me.
~~PageV02P0204
# i didn't have anything personal with christians, but i found that the
~~religion itself contained many inconsistencies, especially when i read
~~the bible. in the bible, the inconsistencies i came across and the
~~things that made no sense at all were so numerous that i actually felt
~~embarrassed that i had never questioned them before or even noticed
~~them! since some people in my family are jewish, i started to research
~~judaism. i thought to myself the answer may be there. so for about a
~~year i did research on anything concerning judaism, i mean in depth
~~research!! everyday i tried to read and learn something (i still know
~~about orthodox jewish kosher laws!). i went to the library and checked
~~out every book on judaism within a two month period, looked up info. on
~~the internet, went to the synagogue, talked with other jewish people in
~~nearby towns and read the torah and talmud. i even had one of my jewish
~~friends come visit me from israel! i thought maybe i had found what i
~~was looking for. yet, the day i was supposed to go the synagogue and
~~meet with the rabbi about possibly making my conversion official, i
~~backed out. i honestly don't know what stopped me from leaving the house
~~that day, but i just stopped as i was about to go out the door and went
~~back in and sat down. i felt like i was in one of those dreams where you
~~try to run but everything is in slow motion. i knew the rabbi was there
~~and waiting for me, but i didn't even call to say i was coming. the
~~rabbi didn't call me either. something was missing... PageV02P0205
# after learning that judaism was also not the answer, i thought (also
~~after much pressure from my parents) to give christianity one more try.
~~i had, as i said, a good background in the technicalities from my years
~~of sunday schools, but i was more concerned with finding the truth
~~behind the technicalities. what was the beauty of it all, where was the
~~security of it and how i could accept it logically? i knew if i were to
~~seriously consider christianity, catholicism was out. i went to every
~~other christian church in my town, lutheran, pentecostal, latter day
~~saints (mormon) , and non-denominational churches. i didn't find what i
~~was looking for- answers!! it wasn't the environment of the people which
~~turned me away, it was the discrepancies between denominations which
~~disturbed me. i believed there had to be one right way, so how could i
~~possibly chose the "right" denomination? in my estimation it was
~~impossible and unfair for a compassionate and merciful god to leave
~~mankind with such a choice. i was lost... at this point i was just as
~~confused and frustrated as when i began my search. i felt like throwing
~~up my arms to god and shouting, "what now?" i wasn't a jew, i wasn't a
~~christian, i was just a person who believed in one god. i thought of
~~giving up organized religion all together. all i wanted was the truth, i
~~didn't care what holy book it came from, i just wanted it. one day i was
~~reading on the internet and decided to take a break and find a chat
~~room. i noticed a "religion chat" which of course i was interested in,
~~so i clicked on it. PageV02P0206
# i saw a room called "muslim chat". should i go in? i was hoping no
~~terrorists would gain access to my e-mail and send me computer viruses-
~~or worse. images of huge men dressed in black with big beards coming to
~~the door and kidnapping me flashed in my brain. (you can tell how much i
~~knew about islam- zero!) but then i thought, c'mon, this is just an
~~innocent investigation. i decided to go in and noticed that the people
~~in this room weren't as scary as i had imagined they would be. in fact,
~~most of them called each other "brother" or "sister" even if they had
~~just met! i said hi to everyone and told them to fill me in on the
~~basics of islam - which i knew nothing about. what they had to say was
~~interesting and coincided with what i already believed. some people
~~offered to send me books so i said okay. (by the way, i never did get
~~any viruses and no men showed up at my door to take me away, except my
~~husband but i went willingly!) when i logged off the chat i went
~~directly to the library and checked out every book on islam, just as i
~~had done with judaism. now i was interested to read and learn more.
~~before i could even get the huge stack of books home, i wanted to look
~~through a few. this was a turning point for me.... the first few i
~~looked through explained the basics in more detail, some were scholarly
~~and some had pictures of huge beautiful mosques with women in scarves.
~~luckily i also checked out a qur'an...i opened it up at random and began
~~to read. PageV02P0207
# the language was what hit me first, i felt an authority talking to me,
~~not a man talking as i had with other "sacred" ****s. the passage i read
~~(and unfortunately i don't know what it was) talked about what god
~~expects you to do in this life and how to live it according to his
~~commandments. it stated that god is the most gracious and merciful and
~~the forgiver. most importantly, unto him is our return. before i knew
~~it, i could hear each of my tear drops as they hit the pages that i was
~~reading. i was crying right in the middle of the library, because
~~finally, after all my searching and wondering i had found what i was
~~looking for- islam. i knew the qur'an was something unique because i had
~~read a lot of religious literature and none of it was ever this clear or
~~gave me such a feeling. now i can see the wisdom of god, masha'allah for
~~letting me explore judaism and christianity so thoroughly before i found
~~islam so i could compare them all and realize that nothing compares to
~~islam. from that point on i kept researching islam. i approached it by
~~looking for inconsistencies as i had done with judaism and christianity,
~~but there wasn't any to be found. i scoured the qur'an, searching for
~~any discrepancy, even to this day i haven't been able to find one
~~inconsistency in it! another great thing i love about the qur'an is it
~~challenges the reader to question it. it says about itself that if it
~~wasn't from god surely you would find a lot of inconsistency in it! not
~~only was islam free of inconsistencies, it had an answer for any
~~question i could think of- an answer that made sense. PageV02P0208
# after three months, i decided that islam was the answer and made my
~~conversion official by saying the shehadah. however, i had to say my
~~shehadah over the speaker phone with an imam from pennsylvania because
~~there were no muslims of mosques near me (the nearest was about 6 hours
~~away). i have never regretted my decision to convert. since there were
~~no muslims living near me i had to take initiative and do much learning
~~on my own but i never grew tired of it because i was learning the truth.
~~accepting islam was like an awakening of my spirit, my mind and even how
~~i viewed the world. i could compare it to someone who has bad eyesight;
~~they struggle to keep up on class, can't concentrate and are constantly
~~challenged by their handicap. if you just give them a pair of glasses
~~everything becomes clear and in focus. this is how my experience of
~~islam is: like receiving a pair of glasses, that have allowed me, for
~~the first time, to really see. well, that's the whole story.. hope you
~~liked it. take care and may allah bless and guide us all! your friend,

~~hayat ann collins osman PageV02P0209
# hayat ann collins osman from devoted christian to devoted muslim hayat
~~ann collins osman, usa (received 01/01/2001) i was raised in a religious
~~christian family. at that time, americans were more religious than they
~~are now—most families went to church every sunday, for example. my
~~parents were involved in the church community. we often had ministers
~~(protestant “priests”) in the house. my mother taught in sunday school,
~~and i helped her. i must have been more religious than other children,
~~although i don’t remember being so. for one birthday, my aunt gave me a
~~bible, and my sister a doll. another time, i asked my parents for a
~~prayer book, and i read it daily for many years. when i was in junior
~~high school (middle school), i attended a bible study program for two
~~years. up to this point, i had read some parts of the bible, but had not
~~understood them very well. now was my chance to learn. unfortunately, we
~~studied many passages in the old and new testament that i found
~~inexplicable, even bizarre. for example, the bible teaches an idea
~~called original sin, which means that humans are all born sinful. i had
~~a baby brother, and i knew that babies were not sinful. the bible has
~~very strange and disturbing stories about prophet abraham and prophet
~~david, for example. i couldn’t understand how prophets could behave the
~~way the bible says they did. there were many, many other things that
~~puzzled me about the bible, but i didn't ask questions. i was afraid to
~~ask—i wanted to me known as a “good girl.” al-hamdulillah, there was a
~~boy who asked, and kept asking. PageV02P0210
# the most critical matter was the notion of trinity. i couldn’t get it.
~~how could god have three parts, one of which was human? having studied
~~greek and roman mythology at school, i thought the idea of the trinity
~~and powerful human saints very similar to the greek and roman ideas of
~~having different so-called “gods” that were in charge of different
~~aspects of life. (astaghfir-ullah!) the boy who asked, asked many
~~questions about trinity, received many answers, and was never satisfied.
~~neither was i. finally, our teacher, a university of michigan professor
~~of theology, told him to pray for faith. i prayed. when i was in high
~~school, i secretly wanted to be a nun. i was drawn to the pattern of
~~offering devotions at set times of day, of a life devoted entirely to
~~god, and of dressing in a way that declared my religious lifestyle. an
~~obstacle to this ambition, though, was that i wasn’t catholic. i lived
~~in a midwestern town where catholics were a distinct, and unpopular
~~minority! furthermore, my protestant upbringing had instilled in me a
~~distaste for religious statuary, and a healthy disbelief that dead
~~saints had the ability to help me. in college, i continued to think and
~~pray. students often talk and argue about religion, and i heard many
~~different ideas. like yusuf islam, i studied the eastern so-called
~~religions: buddhism, confucianism, and hinduism. no help there. i met a
~~muslim from libya, who told me a little about islam and the holy qur’an.
~~he told me that islam is the modern, most up-to-date form of revealed
~~religion. PageV02P0211
# because i thought of africa and the middle east as backwards places, i
~~couldn’t see islam as modern. my family took this libyan brother to a
~~christmas church service. the service was breathtakingly beautiful, but
~~at the end, he asked, “who made up this procedure? who taught you when
~~to stand and bow and kneel? who taught you how to pray?” i told him
~~about early church history, but his question made me angry at first, and
~~later made me think. had the people who designed the worship service
~~really been qualified to do so? how had they known the form that worship
~~should take? had they had divine instruction? i knew that i did not
~~believe in many of the teachings of christianity, but continued to
~~attend church. when the congregation recited pieces i believed to be
~~blasphemous, such as the nicene creed, i was silent—i didn’t recite
~~them. i felt almost alien in church, almost a stranger. i knew that i
~~did not believe in many of the teachings of christianity, but continued
~~to attend church. when the congregation recited pieces i believed to be
~~blasphemous, such as the nicene creed, i was silent—i didn’t recite
~~them. i felt almost alien in church, almost a stranger. horror! someone
~~very close to me, having dire marital problems, went to a curate of our
~~church for advice. taking advantage of her pain and self-loathing, he
~~took her to a motel and seduced her. up to this point, i had not
~~considered carefully the role of the clergy in christian life. now i had
~~to. PageV02P0212
# most christians believe that forgiveness comes through the “holy
~~communion” service, and that the service must be conducted by an
~~ordained priest or minister. no minister, no absolution. i went to
~~church again, and sat and looked at the ministers in front. they were no
~~better than the congregation—some of them were worse. how could it be
~~true that the agency of a man, of any human being, was necessary for
~~communion with god? why couldn’t i deal with god directly, and receive
~~his absolution directly? soon after this, i found a translation of the
~~meaning of the qur’an in a bookstore, bought it, and started to read it.
~~i read it, off and on, for eight years. during this time, i continued to
~~investigate other religions. i grew increasingly aware of and afraid of
~~my sins. how could i know whether god would forgive me? i no longer
~~believed that the christian model, the christian way of being forgiven,
~~would work. my sins weighed heavily on me, and i didn’t know how to
~~escape the burden of them. i longed for forgiveness. i read in the
~~qur’an, “ ... nearest among them in love to the believers you will find
~~those who say, ‘we are christian': because amongst them are men devoted
~~to learning, and men who have renounced the world and are not arrogant.
~~and when they listen to the revelation received by the messenger, you
~~will see their eyes overflowing with tears, for they recognize the
~~truth. they pray, ‘our lord! we believe. write us down among the
~~witnesses. PageV02P0213
# what cause can we have not to believe in allah and the truth which has
~~come to us, seeing that we long for our lord to admit us to the company
~~of the righteous?” --the holy qur’an chapter 5, the table verses 82-84.
~~i saw muslims praying on the tv news, and wanted to learn how. i found a
~~book (by a non-muslim) that described it, and i tried to do it myself.
~~(i knew nothing of taharah -- ritural purity -- and did not pray
~~correctly.) i prayed in my own strange, desperate way, secretly and
~~alone, for several years. i memorized some parts of the qur'an in
~~english, not knowing that muslims memorize the qur'an in arabic.
~~finally, after eight years of reading the qur’an, i found this verse::
~~“this day have i perfected your religion for you, completed my favor for
~~you, and chosen islam as your religion.” --the holy qur’an chapter 5,
~~the table verse 3. i wept for joy, because i knew that, way back in
~~time, before the creation of the earth, allah had written this qur’an
~~for me. allah had known that anne collins, in cheektowaga, ny, usa,
~~would read this verse of the qur’an in may 1986, and be saved. now, i
~~knew that there were many things i had to learn, for example, how to
~~offer the formal muslim prayer. the problem was that i didn’t know any
~~muslims. muslims are much more visible in the us now than they were
~~then. i didn’t know where to find them. i found the phone number of the
~~islamic society in the phone book, and dialed it, but when a man
~~answered, i panicked and hung up. PageV02P0214
# what was i going to say? how would they answer me? would they be
~~suspicious? why would they want me, when they had each other and their
~~islam? in the next couple of months, i called the mosque a number of
~~times, and each time panicked and hung up. finally, i did the cowardly
~~thing: i wrote a letter asking for information. the kindly, patient
~~brother at the mosque phoned me, and then started sending me pamphlets
~~about islam. i told him i wanted to be muslim, but he told me, “wait
~~until you are sure.” it upset me that he told me to wait, but i knew he
~~was right, that i had to be sure because, once i had accepted islam,
~~nothing would ever be the same again. i became obsessed with islam. i
~~thought about it, day and night. on several occasions, i drove to the
~~mosque (at that time, it was in an old converted house) and circled it
~~many times, hoping to see a muslim, wondering what it was like inside.
~~finally, one day in early november 1986, as i was working in the
~~kitchen, i suddenly knew, knew that i was muslim. still a coward, i sent
~~the mosque another letter. it said, “i believe in allah, the one true
~~god, i believe that muhammad was his messenger, and i want to be counted
~~among the witnesses.” the brother called me on the phone the next day,
~~and i said my shahadah* on the phone to him. he told me then that allah
~~had forgiven all my sins at that moment, and that i was as pure as a
~~newborn baby. i felt the burden of sin slip off my shoulders, and wept
~~for joy. i slept little that night, weeping, and repeating allah’s name.
~~forgiveness had been granted. alhamdulillah. PageV02P0215

~~(lebanon) PageV02P0216
# fouad haddad (lebanon) written on the 19th of ramadan 1417 (28 january
~~1997) i was born and raised in a typical middle-class lebanese catholic
~~family in beirut, lebanon. two years into the war i was forced to leave,
~~and completed high school in england. then i went to columbia college in
~~new york. after my ba i went back to lebanon and taught at my old
~~school. two years later i left lebanon again, this time of my own free
~~will, although it was a more wrenching separation than the first. i left
~~behind my war-torn country and made for my new land of opportunities. i
~~was demoralized, and spiritually at a complete impass. with my uncle's
~~support i went back to graduate studies at columbia. this is the brief
~~story of my conversion to islam while there. while in lebanon i had come
~~to realize that i was a nominal christian who did not really live
~~according to what he knew were the norms of his faith. i decided than
~~whenever the chance came i would try my best to live according to my
~~idea of christian standards for one year, no matter the cost. i took
~~this challenge while at columbia. a graduate student's life is blessed
~~with the leisure necessary for spiritual and intellectual exploration.
~~in the process i read and meditated abundantly, and i prayed earnestly
~~for dear guidance. my time was shared literally between the church and
~~the library, and i gradually got rid of all that stood in the way of my
~~experiment, especially social attachments or activities that threatened
~~to steal my time and concentration. i only left campus to visit my
~~mother every now and then. PageV02P0217
# certain meetings and experiences had set me on the road of inquiry
~~about islam. during a scholarship year spent in paris i had bought a
~~complete set of tapes of the holy qur'an. back in new york i listened to
~~its recitation for the first time, as i read simultaneously the
~~translation, drinking in its awesome beauty. i paid particular attention
~~to the passages that concerned christians. i felt an inviting
~~familiarity to it because undoubtedly the one i addressed in my prayers
~~was the same one that spoke this speech, even as i squirmed at some of
~~the "verses of threat". after some time i knew that this was my path,
~~since i had become convinced of the heavenly origin of the qur'an. i was
~~reading many books at the same time. two of them were martin lings'
~~"life of muhammad" and fariduddin attar's "book of secrets" (persian
~~"asrar-nama", in french translation). i found extremely inspiring lings'
~~account of shaykh ahmad `alawi's life in his book "a sufi saint of the
~~twentieth century." i did not finish the latter before i became a
~~muslim; but i am jumping ahead. at any rate, it now seemed my previous
~~experience of religion had been like learning the alphabet in
~~comparison, even my early morning and late night bible readings and my
~~past studies in the original latin of saint augustine, who had once
~~towered in my life as a spiritual giant. PageV02P0218
# i began to long almost physically for a kind of prayer closer to the
~~islamic way, which to me held promises of great spiritual fulfillment,
~~although i had grown completely dependent on certain spiritual habits --
~~particularly communion and prayer -- and could hardly do without them.
~~and yet i had unmistakable signs pointing me in a further direction. one
~~of them i considered almost a slap in the face in its frankness: when i
~~told my local priest about the attraction i felt towards islam he
~~responded as he should, but then closed his talk with the words: allahu
~~akbar. "allahu akbar"? an italian-american priest?! i went to two new
~~york mosques but the imams there wanted to talk about the bible or about
~~the middle east conflict, i suppose to make polite conversation with me.
~~i realized they did not necessarily see what drove me to them and yet i
~~did not find an avenue where i would pluck up the courage to declare my
~~intention. then i would go home and tell myself: another day has passed,
~~and you are still not muslim. finally i went to the muslim student group
~~at columbia and announced my intention, and declared the two shahada:
~~the arabic formula that consists in saying "i bear witness that there is
~~no god but allah" -- the arabic name for god -- "and i bear witness that
~~muhammad is his prophet." they taught me ablution and salat (prayer),
~~and i gained a dear friend among them. those days are marked in my life
~~with letters of light. another close friend of mine played a role in
~~this conversion. this devout american christian friend had entered islam
~~years before me. PageV02P0219
# at the time i felt in my silly pride that it was wrong for an american
~~to enter into the religion of the arabs and for me, an arab, to stand
~~like a mule in complete ignorance of it. it had a great effect on me
~~from both sides: the cultural one and the spiritual, because he was --
~~is -- an honest and upright person whose major move meant a great deal
~~to me. i had also come to realize that my early education in lebanon had
~~carefully ****tered me from islam, even though i lived in a mixed
~~neighborhood in the middle of beirut. i went to my father's and
~~grandfather's jesuit school. the following incident is proof that there
~~is no turning away of allah's gift when he decides to give it. one year,
~~when i was 12, a strange religious education teacher gave us as an
~~assignment the task of learning the fatiha -- the first chapter of the
~~qur'an -- by heart. i went home and did, and it stayed with me all my
~~life. after parents complained he was fired -- "we do not send our
~~children to a christian school in order for them to learn the religion
~~of muslims" -- but the seed had been sown, right there in the staunch
~~christian heartland, inside its prize school. now here i was in the
~~united states, knocking at the door of the religion of the prophet,
~~peace be upon him! days after i took shahada i met my teacher and the
~~light on my path, shaykh hisham kabbani of tripoli, after which i met
~~his own teacher, shaykh nazim al-haqqani of cyprus. may allah bless and
~~grant them long life. PageV02P0220
# through them, after some years, my mother also took shahada and i hope
~~and pray every day that my two brothers and stepfather will soon follow
~~in allah's immense generosity. allah's blessings and peace on the
~~prophet, his family, his companions, and all prophets. source

~~PageV02P0221
# monica (ecuador/usa) assalamu aleykum! i was born in a catholic family
~~in ecuador. my family was never very religious. i mean, they didn't go
~~to church or things like that, except for my grandma whom i loved very
~~much. however, they sent me to a catholic high school. there, i learned
~~about the religion and i also learned about the spiritual side of life.
~~years later, i had the opportunity to go to a college in the u.s. over
~~there, there were a good number of muslims studying. i didn't know
~~anything at all about islam at first. sometimes i saw them performing
~~prayers. i had never seen a prayer like that. i thought it was very
~~peaceful, and they seemed to have so much faith while doing it. this is
~~the first thing that attracted me to islam. actually, it wasn't until i
~~was about to come back home, when i was finishing school, that i decided
~~to learn more about this religion. i always liked to learn about other
~~beliefs and cultures. but this was time that i especially felt
~~unsatisfied about catholicism. then, i tried to contact some people at
~~the masjid. finally, they led me to a sister who was teaching classes
~~for converts at the mosque. i started attending these classes, and after
~~a few months i decided that islam was the religion for me. islam, in
~~contrast to catholicism, seemed very pure. i mean, like it had very
~~little influence from people. it seemed perfect. it was hard to find
~~anything i could disagree with. its hard for me to express the
~~difference i felt between these two religions... PageV02P0222
# i also feel that with islam i'm sort of more guided, either by the
~~quran or the hadiths. whereas, when i was catholic, it was kind of like
~~i had to figure out what to do in certain situation. people might think
~~that islam is strict, but i think thats the way its meant to be. i mean,
~~i feel in this way god tells us very clearly what he expects. and you
~~don't have to just wonder in the world looking for the truth, or the
~~real happiness, or things like that. islam hasn't been easy, i have to
~~admit. for those coming from other religions, and for muslims too, i'd
~~like to say that its very important to respect others, and to learn to
~~listen to them. one of the problems with islam has been that muslims
~~have been so closed to other people, that they cant get to know us or
~~the religion. i also think that muslims should be more open to converts,
~~and more respectful to them. i myself felt sometimes rejected by both
~~groups, the muslims and my old catholic friends. i've met other
~~converts, and often they seem like they have more faith than a muslim-
~~born person. so, i think they deserve some credit for that. it's very
~~unfair to treat them as if they were not real muslims. well, thats about
~~it. i hope im not missing anything. of course there are many things id
~~like to say. but its getting too long. source

~~PageV02P0223
# kaci starbuck my first realization about the christian idea of
~~salvation came after i was baptized into a southern baptist church at a
~~young age. i was taught in sunday school that "if you aren't baptized,
~~then you are going to hell". my own baptism had taken place because i
~~wanted to please people. my mom had come into my room one evening and i
~~asked her about baptism. she encouraged me to do it. so, the next
~~sunday, i decided to go to the front of the church. during a hymn at the
~~end of the sermon, i walked forward to meet with the youth minister. he
~~had a smile on his face, greeted me, then sat beside me on a pew. he
~~asked a question, "why do you want to do this?"... i paused, then said,
~~"because i love jesus and i know that he loves me". after making the
~~statement, the members of the church came up and hugged me...
~~anticipating the ceremonial immersion in water just a few weeks later.
~~during my early years at church, even in the kindergarten class, i
~~remember being a vocal participant in the sunday school lessons. later,
~~in my early adolescent years i was a member of the young girls' group
~~that gathered at the church for weekly activities and went on annual
~~retreats to a camp. during my youth, i attended a camp with older
~~members of the youth group. though i hadn't spent much time with them
~~before, they recognized me as "the daughter of a youth coordinator" or
~~"the girl who plays piano at special occations at church". one evening
~~at this camp a man was speaking about his marriage. he told the story
~~about meeting his wife. PageV02P0224
# he had grown up in the us where dating was normal, but in the girl's
~~culture, he could only be with her if they had a guardian with them.
~~since he liked her, he decided to continue seeing her. another
~~stipulation is that they could not touch each other until she had been
~~given a promise ring. once he proposed to her, they were allowed to hold
~~hands. -this baffled me, yet held me in awe. it was beautiful to think
~~that such discovery of another person could be saved until a commitment
~~was made. though i enjoyed the story, i never thought that the same
~~incident could occur again. a few years later, my parents divorced and
~~the role of religion changed in my life. i had always seen my family
~~through the eyes of a child - they were perfect. my dad was a deacon in
~~the church, well respected, and known by all. my mom was active with
~~youth groups. when my mom left, i took the role of caretaker of my
~~father and two brothers. we continued to go to church, but when visiting
~~my mom on weekends, the visits to churches became more infrequent. when
~~at my dad's home we would gather at night every night to read
~~corinthians 1:13 (which talks about love/charity). my brothers, father,
~~and i repeated this so often that i memorized it. it was a source of
~~support for my dad, though i could not understand why. in a period of
~~three consecutive years, my older brother, younger brother, and i moved
~~to my mom's house. at that point my mom no longer went to church, so my
~~brothers found church attendance less important. PageV02P0225
# having moved to my mother's house during my junior year of high
~~school, i was to discover new friends and a different way of life. the
~~first day of school i met a girl who was very friendly. the second day
~~of school, she invited me to her house for the weekend - to meet her
~~family and visit her church. i was automatically "adopted" into her
~~family as a "good kid" and "good influence" for her. also, i was
~~surprisingly shocked at the congregation that attended her church.
~~though i was a stranger, all of the women and men greeted me with hugs
~~and kisses and made me feel welcome. after continually spending time
~~with the family and attending church on the weekends, they started
~~talking to me about particular beliefs in their church of christ. this
~~group went by the new testament (literal interpretation of paul's
~~writings). they had no musical instruments in church services - only
~~vocal singing; there were no hired preachers, but elders who would bring
~~sermons each sunday. women were not allowed to speak in church.
~~christmas, easter, and other holidays were not celebrated, wine and
~~unleavened bread were taken as communion every sunday, and baptism was
~~seen as immediately necessary at the moment that the sinner decided to
~~become a believer. though i was already considered a christian, members
~~of this congregation believed that i was going to hell if i didn't get
~~baptized again - in their church, their way. this was the first major
~~blow to my belief system. PageV02P0226
# had i grown up in a church where everything had been done wrong? did i
~~really have to be baptized again? at one point i had a discussion about
~~faith with my mom. i told her about my confusion and just wanted
~~somebody to clear things up for me. i became critical of sermons at all
~~churches because the preachers would just tell stories and not focus on
~~the bible. i couldn't understand: if the bible was so important, why was
~~it not read (solely) in the church service? though i thought about
~~baptism every sunday for almost two years, i could not walk forward to
~~be baptized. i would pray to god to push me forward if it were the right
~~thing to do - but it never happened. the next year i went to college and
~~became detached from all churches as a freshman. some sundays i would
~~visit churches with friends - only to feel critical of the sermons. i
~~tried to join the baptist student association, but felt that things were
~~wrong there, too. i had come to college thinking that i would find
~~something like the church of christ but it was not to be found. when i
~~would return home to my mom's house on occassional weekends, i would
~~visit the church to gain the immediate sense of community and welcoming.
~~in my sophomore year, i spent sundays singing at the wake forest church
~~in the choir because i earned good money. though i didn't support the
~~church beliefs, i endured the sermons to make money. in october of my
~~sophomore year i met a muslim who lived in my dorm. he was a friendly
~~guy who always seemed to be pondering questions or carrying a deep
~~thought. PageV02P0227
# one evening i spent the entire evening asking him philosophical
~~questions about beliefs and religion. he talked about his beliefs as a
~~shia' ismaili imami muslim. though his thoughts did not fully represent
~~this sect of islam (since he was also confused and searching for
~~answers), his initial statements made me question my own beliefs: are we
~~born into a religion, therefore making it the right one? day after day i
~~would meet with him and ask questions - wanting to get on the same level
~~of communication that we had reached at our initial meeting - but he
~~would not longer answer the questions or meet the spiritual needs that i
~~had. the following summer i worked at a bookstore and grabbed any books
~~that i could find about islam. i introduced myself to another muslim on
~~campus and started asking him questions about islam. instead of looking
~~to him for answers, i was directed to the quran. any time i would have
~~general questions about islam, he would answer them. i went to the local
~~mosque twice during that year and was happy to feel a sense of community
~~again. after reading about islam over the summer, i became more
~~sensitive to statements made about muslims. while taking an introductory
~~half-semester couse on islam, i would feel frustrated when the professor
~~would make a comment the was incorrect, but i didn't know how to correct
~~him. outside of my personal studies and university class, i became an
~~active worker and supporter of our newly rising campus islam awareness
~~organization. as the only female member, i would be identified to others
~~as "the christian in the group". PageV02P0228
# every time a muslim would say that, i would look at him with
~~puzzlement - because i thought that i was doing all that they had been
~~doing - and that i was a muslim, too. i had stopped eating pork and
~~became vegetarian, had never liked alcohol, and had begun fasting for
~~the month of ramadhan. but, there still was a difference... at the end
~~of that year (junior year) other changes were made. i decided to start
~~wearing my hair up - concealed from people. once again, i thought of
~~this as something beautiful and had an idea that only my husband should
~~be able to see my hair. i hadn't even been told about hijab... since
~~many of the sisters at the mosque did not wear it. that summer i was
~~sitting at school browsing the internet and looking for sites about
~~islam. i wanted to find e-mail addresses for muslims, but couldn't find
~~a way. i eventually ventured onto a homepage that was a matrimonial
~~link. i read over some advertisements and tried to find some people
~~within my age range to write to about islam. i prefaced my initial
~~letters with "i am not seeking marriage - i just want to learn about
~~islam". within a few days i had received replies from three muslims- one
~~from pakistan/india who was studying in the us, one from india but
~~studying in the uk, and one living in the uae. each brother was helpful
~~in unique ways - but i started corresponding with the one from the us
~~the most because we were in the same time zone. i would send questions
~~to him and he would reply with thorough, logical answers. PageV02P0229
# by this point i knew that islam was right - all people were equal
~~regardless of color, age, sex, race, etc; i had received answers to
~~troublesome questions by going to the qur'an, i could feel a sense of
~~community with muslims, and i had a strong, overwhelming need to declare
~~the shahada at a mosque. no longer did i have the "christian fear" of
~~denouncing the claim of jesus as god - i believed that there was only
~~one god and there should be no associations with god. one thursday night
~~in july 1997 i talked with the brother over the phone. i asked more
~~questions and received many more pertinent, logical answers. i decided
~~that the next day i would go to the mosque. i went to the mosque with
~~the muslim brother from wake forest and his non-muslim sister, but did
~~not tell him my intentions. i mentioned that i wanted to speak with the
~~imam after the khutbah [religious directed talk]. the imam delivered the
~~khutbah, the muslims prayed [which includes praising allah, recitation
~~of the quran, and a series of movements which includes bowing to allah]
~~then he came over to talk with me. i asked him what was necessary to
~~become muslim. he replied that there are basics to understand about
~~islam, plus the shahada [there is no god but allah and muhammad is the
~~messenger of allah]. i told him that i had learned about islam for more
~~than a year and was ready to become muslim. i recited the kalimah... and
~~became muslim on july 12, 1996, alhumdulillah [all praise due to allah].
~~that was the first big step. many doors opened after that - and have
~~continued to open by the grace of allah. PageV02P0230
# i first began to learn prayer, then visited another masjid in winston-
~~salem, and began wearing hijab two weeks later. .... at my summer job, i
~~had problems with wearing hijab. the bosses didn't like it and "let me
~~go" early for the summer. they didn't think that i could "perform" my
~~job of selling bookbags because the clothing would limit me. but, i
~~found the hijab very liberating. i met muslims as they would walk around
~~the mall... everyday i met someone new, alhumdulillah. as my senior year
~~of college progressed, i took the lead of the muslim organization on
~~campus because i found that the brothers were not very active. since i
~~pushed the brothers to do things and constantly reminded them of events,
~~i received the name "mother kaci". during the last half of my senior
~~year, i took elective courses: islam, christianity, and judaism. each
~~course was good because i was a minority representative in each.
~~mashallah, it was nice to represent islam and to tell people the truth
~~about muslims and allah. source

~~PageV02P0231
# karima slack razi i took the shahadah on september 20, 1991. if you
~~had told me 5 years prior that i would embrace islam, i never would have
~~believed you. in retrospect, allah's guidance was so subtle yet
~~consistent, that now i see my whole life as leading up to that moment.
~~it is difficult to encapsulate the exact factors that brought me to
~~islam because it was a journey, a process, that lasted three years.
~~those three years were both exhilarating and exhausting. my perceptions
~~of myself and the world changed dramatically. some beliefs were
~~validated; others, shattered. at times i feared i would lose myself; at
~~other times i knew that this path was my destiny and embraced it.
~~throughout those years, a series of aspects of islam intrigued me.
~~slowly and gradually, my studies led me towards the day when i took the
~~declaration of faith, the shahadah. prior to my introduction to islam, i
~~knew that i yearned for more spiritual fulfillment in my life. but, as
~~yet, nothing had seemed acceptable or accessible to me. i had been
~~brought up essentially a secular humanist. morals were emphasized, but
~~never attributed to any spiritual or divine being. the predominant
~~religion of our country, christianity, seemed to burden a person with
~~too much guilt. i was not really familiar with any other religions. i
~~wish i could say that, sensing my spiritual void, i embarked on a
~~spiritual quest and studied various religions in depth. however, i was
~~too comfortable with my life for that. i come from a loving and
~~supportive family. i had many interesting and supportive friends.
~~PageV02P0232
# i thoroughly enjoyed my university studies and i was successful at the
~~university. instead, it was the "chance" meeting of various muslims that
~~instigated my study of islam. sharif was one of the first muslims who
~~intrigued me. he was an elderly man who worked in a tutorial program for
~~affirmative action that i had just entered. he explained that while his
~~job brought little monetary reward, the pleasure he gained from teaching
~~students brought him all the reward he needed. he spoke softly and
~~genuinely. his demeanor more than his words caught me, and i thought, "i
~~hope i have his peace of spirit when i reach his age." that was in 1987.
~~as i met more muslims, i was struck not only by their inner peace, but
~~by the strength of their faith. these gentle souls contrasted with the
~~violent, sexist image i had of islam. then i met imran, a muslim friend
~~of my brother's who i soon realized was the type of man i would like to
~~marry. he was intelligent, sincere, independent, and at peace with
~~himself. when we both agreed that there was potential for marriage, i
~~began my serious studies of islam. initially, i had no intention of
~~becoming muslim; i only desired to understand his religion because he
~~had made it clear that he would want to raise his children as muslims.
~~my response was: "if they will turn out as sincere, peaceful and kind as
~~he is, then i have no problem with it. but i do feel obligated to
~~understand islam better first." in retrospect, i realize that i was
~~attracted to these peaceful souls because i sensed my own lack of inner
~~peace and conviction. PageV02P0233
# there was an inner void that was not completely satisfied with
~~academic success or human relationships. however, at that point i would
~~never have stated that i was attracted to islam for myself. rather, i
~~viewed it as an intellectual pursuit. this perception was compatible
~~with my controlled, academic lifestyle. since i called myself a
~~feminist, my early reading centered around women in islam. i thought
~~islam oppressed women. in my womens studies courses i had read about
~~muslim women who were not allowed to leave their homes and were forced
~~to cover their heads. of course i saw hijab as an oppressive tool
~~imposed by men rather than as an expression of self-respect and dignity.
~~what i discovered in my readings surprised me. islam not only does not
~~oppress women, but actually liberates them, having given them rights in
~~the 6th century that we have only gained in this century in this
~~country: the right to own property and wealth and to maintain that in
~~her name after marriage; the right to vote; and the right to divorce.
~~this realization was not easy in coming....i resisted it every step of
~~the way. but there were always answers to my questions. why is there
~~polygamy? it is only allowed if the man can treat all four equally and
~~even then it is discouraged. however, it does allow for those times in
~~history when there are more women than men, especially in times of war,
~~so that some women are not deprived of having a relationship and
~~children. PageV02P0234
# furthermore, it is far superior to the mistress relationship so
~~prevalent here since the woman has a legal right to support should she
~~have a child. this was only one of many questions, the answers to which
~~eventually proved to me that women in islam are given full rights as
~~individuals in society. however, these discoveries did not allay all my
~~fears. the following year was one of intense emotional turmoil. having
~~finished up my courses for my masters in latin american studies in the
~~spring of 1989, i decided to take a year to substitute teach. this
~~enabled me to spend a lot of time studying islam. many things i was
~~reading about islam made sense. however, they didn't fit into my
~~perception of the world. i had always perceived of religion as a crutch.
~~but could it be that it was the truth? didn't religions cause much of
~~the oppression and wars in the world? how then could i be considering
~~marrying a man who followed one of the world's major religions? every
~~week i was hit with a fresh story on the news, the radio or the
~~newspaper about the oppression of muslim women. could i, a feminist,
~~really be considering marrying into that society? eyebrows were raised.
~~people talked about me in worried tones behind my back. in a matter of
~~months, my secure world of 24 years was turned upside down. i no longer
~~felt that i knew what was right or wrong. what was black and white, was
~~now all gray. but something kept me going. and it was more than my
~~desire to marry imran. PageV02P0235
# at any moment i could have walked away from my studies of islam and
~~been accepted back into a circle of feminist, socialist friends and into
~~the loving arms of my family. while these people never deserted me, they
~~haunted me with their influence. i worried about what they would say or
~~think, particularly since i had always judged myself through the eyes of
~~others. so i secluded myself. i talked only with my family and friends
~~that i knew wouldn't judge me. and i read. it was no longer an
~~interested, disinterested study of islam. it was a struggle for my own
~~identity. up to that time i had produced many successful term papers. i
~~knew how to research and to support a thesis. but my character had never
~~been at stake. for the first time, i realized that i had always written
~~to please others. now, i was studying for my own spirit. it was scary.
~~although i knew my friends and family loved me, they couldn't give me
~~the answers. i no longer wanted to lean on their support. imran was
~~always there to answer my questions. while i admired his patience and
~~his faith that all would turn out for the best, i didn't want to lean
~~too heavily on him out of my own fear that i might just be doing this
~~for a man and not for myself. i felt i had nothing and no one to lean
~~on. alone, frightened and filled with self-doubt, i continued to read.
~~after i had satisfied my curiosity about women in islam and been
~~surprised by the results, i began to read about the life of the prophet
~~muhammad and to read the qu'ran itself. PageV02P0236
# as i read about the prophet muhammad (pbuh), i began to question my
~~initial belief that he was merely an exceptional leader. his honesty
~~prior to any revelations, his kindness, his sagacity, his insights into
~~his present as well as the future--all made me question my initial
~~premise. his persistence in adversity and, later, his humility in the
~~face of astounding success seemed to belie human nature. even at the
~~height of his success when he could have enjoyed tremendous wealth, he
~~refused to have more than his poorest companions in islam. slowly i was
~~getting deeper and deeper into the qu'ran. i asked, "could a human being
~~be capable of such a subtle, far-reaching book?" furthermore, there are
~~parts that are meant to guide the prophet himself, as well as reprimand
~~him. i wondered if the prophet would have reprimanded himself. as i
~~slowly made my way through the qu'ran, it became less and less an
~~intellectual activity, and more and more a personal struggle. there were
~~days when i would reject every word--find a way to condemn it, not allow
~~it to be true. but then i would suddenly happen upon a phrase that spoke
~~directly to me. this first happened when i was beginning to experience a
~~lot of inner turmoil and doubt and i read some verses towards the end of
~~the second chapter: "allah does not burden any human being with more
~~than he is well able to bear" (2:286). although i would not have stated
~~that i believed in allah at that time, when i read these words it was as
~~if a burden was lifted from my heart. i continued to have many fears as
~~i studied islam. PageV02P0237
# would i still be close to my family if i became a muslim? would i end
~~up in an oppressive marriage? would i still be "open-minded?" i believed
~~secular humanism to be the most open-minded approach to life. slowly i
~~began to realize that secular humanism is as much an ideology, a dogma,
~~as islam. i realized that everyone had their ideology and i must
~~consciously choose mine. i realized that i had to have trust in my own
~~intellect and make my own decisions--that i should not be swayed by the
~~negative reactions of my "open-minded," "progressive" friends. during
~~this time, as i started keeping more to myself, i was becoming
~~intellectually freer than any time in my life. two and a half years
~~later, i had finished the qu'ran, been delighted by its de******ions of
~~nature and often reassured by its wisdom. i had learned about the
~~extraordinary life of prophet muhammad (pbuh); i had been satisfied by
~~the realization that islam understands that men and women are different
~~but equal; and i discovered that islam gave true equality not only to
~~men and women, but to all races and social classes, judging only by
~~one's level of piety. and i had gained confidence in myself and my own
~~decisions. it was then that i came to the final, critical question: do i
~~believe in one god? this is the basis of being a muslim. having
~~satisfied my curiosity about the rules and historical emergence of
~~islam, i finally came to this critical question, the essence of being
~~muslim. it was as if i had gone backwards: starting with the details
~~before i finally reached the spiritual question. PageV02P0238
# i had to wade through the technicalities and satisfy my academic side
~~before i could finally address the spiritual question. did i.... could i
~~place my trust in a greater being? could i relinquish my secular
~~humanist approach to life? twice i decided to take the shahadah and then
~~changed my mind the next day. one afternoon, i even knelt down and
~~touched my forehead to the floor, as i had often seen muslims do, and
~~asked for guidance. i felt such peace in that position. perhaps in that
~~moment i was a muslim a heart, but when i stood up, my mind was not
~~ready to officially take the shahadah. after that moment a few more
~~weeks passed. i began my new job: teaching high school. the days began
~~to pass very quickly, a flurry of teaching, discipline and papers to
~~correct. as my days began to pass so fast, it struck me that i did not
~~want to pass from this world without having declared my faith in allah.
~~intellectually, i understood that the evidence present in the prophet
~~muhammad's (pbuh) life and in the qu'ran was too compelling to deny.
~~and, at that moment, i was also ready in my heart for islam. i had spent
~~my life longing for a truth in which heart would be compatible with
~~mind, action with thought, intellect with emotion. i found that reality
~~in islam. with that reality came true self-confidence and intellectual
~~freedom. a few days after i took the shahadah , i wrote in my journal
~~that finally i have found in islam the validation of my inner thoughts
~~and intuition. by acknowledging and accepting allah, i have found the
~~door to spiritual and intellectual freedom. source PageV02P0239

~~bismillah ar-rahman ar-raheem discovering islam: a canadian muslima's
~~story april 25, 1996 as-salamu alaikum wa rahmahtullahi wa barakatu (may
~~the peace, the mercy, and the blessings of allah be upon you). i am
~~canadian-born of scandinavian and other ancestry, and i was raised in
~~canada. i have been a muslima since february 1993 when i was 23. while
~~growing up, i was never affiliated with any religion nor was i an
~~atheist. when i was in my mid-teens i started to think somewhat about
~~religion and at that time i did believe in the oneness of god (tawheed).
~~christianity never interested me. my first contact with muslims occurred
~~when i was introduced to some muslim international students in 1988.
~~through them i learned a bit about islam, such as ramadan fasting. but
~~it was really not until 1992 that i became interested in islam. in the
~~summer of that year a canadian newspaper published a series of articles
~~attacking islam by using examples of anti-islamic behaviour of some
~~muslims in an attempt to vilify islam itself. non-muslims tend to judge
~~islam on the basis of the behaviour (which is not necessarily islamic)
~~of muslims. i was not yet a muslima but the articles were so outrageous
~~that i sent a letter to the editor in defence of islam. now i was
~~curious about islam. i re-read some articles i had picked up several
~~months earlier from the msa islam awareness week display at my
~~university. one was about 'isa (alaihe salam) [jesus] as a prophet of
~~islam. PageV02P0240
# also, i asked a muslim to get me some books about islam; they were
~~about the overall ideology of islam and were written by two famous
~~muslim authors. impressed, i thought, "this is islam? it seems so
~~right." over the next few months in my free time while attending
~~university i continued to learn about islam from authentic islamic
~~books, for example the life of muhammad (salallahu alaihe wa salam) by
~~dr. muhammad haykal. one certainly does not learn the truth about islam
~~from the mass media! also, newcomers to islam especially must be careful
~~to avoid the writings of deviant groups which claim ties to islam so as
~~not to be misled. and just because the author has an arabic name does
~~not necessarily mean that he or she is a knowledgeable muslim or even
~~muslim at all. also, i learned about islam from some kind, knowledgeable
~~muslims and muslimas who did not pressure me. meanwhile, i had begun to
~~islamize my behaviour which did not require huge change. i already
~~avoided consuming alcohol and pig meat. also, i always preferred to
~~dress conservatively/modestly and not wear makeup, perfume, or jewellery
~~outside my home. i started to eat only islamically slaughtered meat.
~~also during this time i visited a masjid (mosque) in my city for the
~~first time. until i discovered islam, i knew almost nothing about it. i
~~say discovered because the "islam" that i had always heard about through
~~the mass media is not true islam. i had always assumed that islam is
~~just another man-made religion, not knowing that it is the truth.
~~PageV02P0241
# i had also assumed that a person had to be raised as a muslim to be
~~one. i was not aware of the fact that all humans are born muslim (in a
~~state of islam - submitted to the creator). like many "westerners" i
~~associated islam with the "east" and did not know that islam is
~~universal in both time and place. however, i never had negative feelings
~~about islam, al-hamdulillah. the more knowledge that i acquired about
~~islam, the more i felt that i too can actually be muslim as i found that
~~many of the beliefs that i already had were actually islamic not merely
~~"common sense." so after familiarizing myself with what islam is
~~basically about and what are the duties and proper conduct of a muslim
~~person, as well as thinking and reflecting, i felt ready to accept islam
~~and live as a muslima. one day while at home i said the shahada
~~(declaration of faith) and began to perform the five daily salawat
~~(prayers), al-hamdulillah. that was in february 1993, several days
~~before the fasting month of ramadan began. i did not want to miss the
~~fasting this time! i found the fasting to be much easier than i had
~~anticipated; before i fasted i had worried that i might faint. at first
~~there was a bit of an adjustment period getting used to the new routine
~~of performing salah and fasting, and i made some mistakes, but it was
~~exciting and not difficult. i started to read the qur'an (abdullah yusuf
~~ali's translation) when i was given one soon after accepting islam.
~~before that i had read only excerpts of it in other books. also in the
~~beginning, i found the lawful and the prohibited in islam by dr.
~~PageV02P0242
# yusuf al-qaradawi to be a useful guide. in january 1996 (during
~~ramadan) i started to wear the islamic headscarf (hijab). i realized
~~that i could not fully submit to allah (swt), which is what being muslim
~~is about, without wearing it. islam must be accepted and practised in
~~its entirety; it is not an "alter-to-suit-yourself" religion. since
~~becoming a muslima i was aware that the headscarf is required of muslim
~~women and i had intended to wear it eventually. i should have worn it
~~immediately upon accepting islam but for many muslimas (even some from
~~muslim families) it is not easy to take that step and put it on in a
~~non-muslim society. it is silly how so many persons get upset over a
~~piece of fabric! also, it is interesting to note that christian nuns are
~~never criticized for covering their heads. never in my life did i have
~~negative feelings toward muhajjabas (women who wear hijab) when i saw
~~them. what made me hesitate to put it on was fearing receiving bad
~~treatment from others, especially family. but we must fear allah (swt)
~~only, not others. in the few months before i permanently put on hijab i
~~started "practising" wearing it. i wore it when i travelled between my
~~home and the local masjid on fridays when i started attending the jum'a
~~salah (friday congregational prayer). (of course, since becoming muslim
~~i always wore it during every salah). a couple of weeks prior, in du'a i
~~began asking allah (swt) to make it easy for me to wear it. PageV02P0243
# the day i finally put it on permanently i had reached the point where
~~i felt that i could no longer go out with a bare head, and i thought
~~"tough bananas" if others do not like me wearing it since i alone am
~~accountable for my actions and am required to perform my islamic duties,
~~and i could never please everyone anyway. sometimes opposition to hijab
~~is a control issue: some persons just plainly do not like those who are
~~determined and independent especially if it is their child. upon wearing
~~it i immediately felt protected and was finally able to go out and not
~~be the target of stares/leers from men. at first i felt a bit self-
~~conscious but after several weeks i felt completely used to wearing
~~hijab. sometimes other persons look puzzled/confused, i think because
~~they are not used to seeing pale-faced, blue-eyed muslimas! by the way,
~~wearing hijab is da'wah in a way as it draws attention to islam. since
~~accepting islam i continue to seek knowledge about the deen (religion)
~~which is a lifelong duty for all muslims--male and female. currently, i
~~am learning arabic and hope to be able to read the qur'an in arabic
~~soon, insha'allah. reading, discussing islam with other muslims, and the
~~friday jum'a khutba are all educational. striving to be as pious as one
~~can be and fighting against one's own evil traits (jihad al-nafs) takes
~~effort and is continuous and never ending for muslims. i find islam
~~ever-more fascinating, and i enjoy living as a muslima. source

~~books i could get my hands on, but they were all written by non-muslims.
~~they said that muhammad (saws) wrote the qur'an in the 7th centruy, that
~~muslims worshipped the black stone, and that islam bred hatred towards
~~women. they also said that muhammad (saws) copied the bible, that islam
~~was spread with the qur'an in one hand and the sword in the other, and
~~implied (if not stated directly) that all muslims were arab. one book
~~even said that the word "allah" came from al-lot, the moon god of the
~~pagan arabs. these are just some of the lies i read. then, one day, two
~~pakistani muslim women (who were also muhajjabas [wearing hijab -ed.])
~~came to my college. i befriended them, and then i started asking them
~~all kinds of questions. i had already left christianity when i was 12,
~~so i felt no challenge to my personal beliefs. i was a biology major and
~~had basically no religion. i was amazed at what they told me, and i
~~realized that all of my previous knowledge was lies. then, i came home
~~for the summer. i got my own apartment and started working at 7-11.
~~while i was working, a black muhajjaba came in the store. i asked her
~~where she worshipped and when she told me there was an islamic center on
~~the same street i was working on, i was amazed. i went the next day, but
~~no one was there. PageV02P0245
# so i went the day after that day (which happened to be friday) and
~~found some people there. a man told me to come the next week at noon so
~~i could meet some of the ladies. but when he said "noon," he meant
~~"dhuhr," not 12. i didn't know that. so i came at 12 the following week,
~~but no one was there. for some reason, i decided to wait, subhan-allah.
~~and wait i did, for an hour and a half (jumaa' [friday prayer -ed.] is
~~at 2), and finally i meet some people. a lady there gave me a copy of
~~maurice bucaille's the bible, qur'an, and science. when i read it, i
~~knew that i wanted to become a muslim. after all, i was a biology major.
~~i knew that the things in the qur'an had to be from allah (swt), and not
~~from an illiterate, uneducated man. so i went the next week and took
~~shahaada [i.e. stated and accepted the creed of islam -ed.] when my dad
~~found out, he went crazy. he came to my apartment and tore up everything
~~in it, including my qur'an. i called the police, and they came out. but
~~they refused to help. they said "don't you think he's right?" and so on.
~~so i fled to nashville, tn. i have continued to talk with my dad,
~~though, because the qur'an says to honour your parents (it does not
~~distinguish between kaafir and muslim parents), and because i remember
~~the story of umar ibn al-khattab (raa). he hated islam so much that he
~~used to beat his slave girl until his arm grew tired. al-hamdu lillah,
~~allah (swt) has rewarded me for my efforts. i saw my father for the
~~first time this summer, in full hijaab. he accepted it without too much
~~commentary. PageV02P0246
# i think he realizes now that he can't bully me into renouncing islam.

~~michelle as-salaamu-alaikum, i come from a jewish family in new york. my
~~mother was from s. a. but also jewish. she never was comfortable with
~~anyone knowing that. when my father died, she remarried a catholic and
~~became one herself. and that is how she brought us up. from the age of 5
~~i was told that jesus was also god...? i never felt comfortable with it.
~~we moved to the philippines - that is where my stepfather was from. and
~~life there was unbearable. my stepfather, to put it mildly, was abusive
~~to me and my 2 brothers. the effect of that hard life: my spelling is
~~poor, one of my brothers is now a drinker, and the other has a low
~~selfworth. when i grew up and we returned to the usa, i left home. i
~~took care of myself by working hard. i never had time for god, whoever
~~he was. i did not feel that god helped me in any way, so why bother? i
~~did try to get back to my roots but judaism made no sense, so i let that
~~go. i did come across muslims from time to time but the effect was, how
~~do they dress that way, and why do they seem different? over time, the
~~idea of islam kept coming back to me, so i tried to find out more. i
~~read the history and life of mohammed (saas). that is what got to me:
~~such kindness and sabr (patience) in the face of hardships. it seemed to
~~me that my life had no direction, so i went to learn more. PageV02P0247
# after reading surah al-fatihah, i knew i had come home - this is where
~~i wanted to be! i became a muslim and have never regretted it. i always
~~knew there was only one god - allah - and things have not been always
~~easy for me. my mother died of cancer soon after i became a muslim. but
~~the faith i have helped me make it. just being able to go to allah with
~~all my pain was such a relief. it is the only true lifestyle known to
~~man, and it is the truth and the last chance for us. i wish all mankind
~~could come to know the truth (haqq) of islam, and its peace and beauty!

~~natassia PageV02P0248
# natassia i was raised to believe in god from childhood. i attended
~~church nearly every sunday, went to bible school, and sang in the choir.
~~yet religion was never a really big part of my life. there were times
~~when i thought myself close to god. i often prayed to him for guidance
~~and strength in times of despair or for a wish in times of want. but i
~~soon realized that this feeling of closeness soon evaporated when i was
~~no longer begging god for something. i realized that i even though i
~~believed, i lacked faith. i perceived the world to be a game in which
~~god indulged in from time to time. he inspired people to write a bible
~~and somehow people were able to find faith within this bible. as i grew
~~older and became more aware of the world, i believed more in god. i
~~believed that there had to be a god to bring some order to the chaotic
~~world. if there were no god, i believed the world would have ended in
~~utter anarchy thousands of years ago. it was comfort to me to believe
~~there was a supernatural force guiding and protecting man. children
~~usually assume their religion from parents. i was no different. at the
~~age of 12, i began to give in depth thinking to my spirituality. i
~~realized there was a void in my life where a faith should be. whenever i
~~was in need or despair, i simply prayed to someone called lord. but who
~~was this lord truly? i once asked my mother who to pray to, jesus or
~~god. believing my mother to be right, i prayed to jesus and to him i
~~attributed all good things. i have heard that religion cannot be argued.
~~my friends and i tried to do this many times. PageV02P0249
# i often had debates with my friends about protestantism, catholicism,
~~and judaism. through these debates i searched within myself more and
~~more and decided i should do something about my emptiness. and so at the
~~age of 13, i began my search for truth. humankind is always in constant
~~pursuit of knowledge or the truth. my search for truth could not be
~~deemed as an active pursuit of knowledge. i continued having the
~~debates, and i read the bible more. but it did not really extend from
~~this. during this period of time my mother took notice of my behavior
~~and from then on i have been in a "religious phase." my behavior was far
~~from a phase. i simply shared my newly gained knowledge with my family.
~~i learned about the beliefs, practices, and doctrines within
~~christianity and minimal beliefs and practices within judaism. a few
~~months within my search i realized that if i believe in christianity i
~~believed myself to be condemned to hell. not even considering the sins
~~of my past, i was on a "one way road to hell" as southern ministers tend
~~to say. i could not believe all the teachings within christianity.
~~however, i did try. i can remember many times being in church and
~~fighting with myself during the call to discipleship. i was told that by
~~simply confessing jesus to be my lord and savior i would be guaranteed
~~eternal life in heaven. i never did walk down the aisle to the pastor's
~~outstretched hands, and my reluctance even increased my fears of heading
~~for hell. during this time i was at unease. i often had alarming
~~nightmares, and i felt very alone in the world. PageV02P0250
# but not only did i lack belief but i had many questions that i posed
~~to every knowledgeable christian i could find and never really did
~~receive a satisfactory answer. i was simply told things that confused me
~~even more. i was told that i am trying to put logic to god and if i had
~~faith i could simply believe and go to heaven. well, that was the
~~problem: i did not have faith. i did not believe. i did not really
~~believe in anything. i did believe there was a god and that jesus was
~~his son sent to save humankind. that was it. my questions and reasoning
~~did, however, exceed my beliefs. the questions went on and on. my
~~perplexity increased. my uncertainty increased. for fifteen years i had
~~blindly followed a faith simply because it was the faith of my parents.
~~something happened in my life in which the little faith i did have
~~decreased to all but nothing. my search came to a stop. i no longer
~~searched within myself, the bible. or church. i had given up for a
~~while. i was a very bitter parson until one day a friend gave me a book.
~~it was called "the muslim-christian dialogue." i took the book and read
~~it. i am ashamed to say that during my searching never did i once
~~consider another religion. christianity was all i knew, and i never
~~thought about leaving it. my knowledge of islam was very minimal. in
~~fact, it was mainly filled with misconception and stereotypes. the book
~~surprised me. i found that i was not the only one who believed there was
~~a simply a god. i asked for more books. i received them as well as
~~pamphlets. i learned about islam from an intellectual aspect.
~~PageV02P0251
# i had a close friend who was muslim and i often asked her questions
~~about the practices. never did i once consider islam as my faith. many
~~things about islam alienated me. after a couple months of reading the
~~month of ramadan began. every friday i could i joined the local muslim
~~community for the breaking of the fast and the reciting of the quran. i
~~posed questions that i may have come across to the muslim girls. i was
~~in awe at how someone could have so much certainty in what they believed
~~and followed. i felt myself drawn to the religion that alienated me.
~~having believed for so long that i was alone, islam did comfort me in
~~many ways. islam was brought as a reminder to the world. it was brought
~~to lead the people back to the right path. beliefs were not the only
~~thing important to me. i wanted a discipline to pattern my life by. i
~~did not just want to believe someone was my savior and through this i
~~held the ticket to heaven. i wanted to know how to act to receive the
~~approval of god. i wanted a closeness to god. i wanted to be god-
~~conscious. most of all i wanted a chance for heaven. i began to feel
~~that christianity did not give this to me, but islam did. i continued
~~learning more. i went to the eid celebration and jumua and weekly
~~classes with my friends. through religion one receives peace of mind. a
~~calmness about them. this i had off and on for about three years. during
~~the off times i was more susceptible to the temptations of satan. in
~~early february of 1997 i came to the realization that islam was right
~~and true. PageV02P0252
# however, i did not want to make any hasty decisions. i did decide to
~~wait. within this duration the temptations of satan increased. i can
~~recollect two dreams in which he was a presence. satan was calling me to
~~him. after i awoke from these nightmares i found solace in islam. i
~~found myself repeating the shahadah. these dreams almost made me change
~~my mind. i confided them in my muslim friend. she suggested that maybe
~~satan was there to lead me from the truth. i never thought of it that
~~way. on march 19, 1997 after returning from a weekly class, i recited
~~the shahadah to myself. then on march 26, i recited it before witnesses
~~and became an official muslim. i cannot express the joy i felt. i cannot
~~express the weight that was lifted from my shoulders. i had finally
~~received my peace of mind. ... it has been about five months since i
~~recited the shahadah. islam has made me a better person. i am stronger
~~now and understand things more. my life has changed significantly. i now
~~have purpose. my purpose is to prove myself worthy of eternal life in
~~jannah. i have my long sought after faith. religion is a part of me all
~~the time. i am striving everyday to become the best muslim i can be.
~~people are often amazed at how a fifteen year old can make such an
~~important decision in life. i am grateful that allah blessed me with my
~~state of mind that i was able to find it so young. striving to be a good
~~muslim in a christian dominated society is hard. living with a christian
~~family is even harder. however, i do not try to get discouraged.
~~PageV02P0253
# i do not wish to dwell on my present predicament, but i believe that
~~my jihad is simply making me stronger. someone once told me that i am
~~better off than some people who were born into islam, in that i had to
~~find, experience, and realize the greatness and mercy of allah. i have
~~acquired the reasoning that seventy years of life on earth is nothing
~~compared to eternal life in paradise. i must admit that i lack the
~~aptitude to express the greatness, mercy, and glory of allah. i hope my
~~account helped others who may feel the way i felt or struggle the way i
~~struggled. as salamu alaikum wa rahmatullahee wa barakatuhu, natassia m.

# shuyaib's path to islam as salaam alaykum. who am i? what am i doing
~~over in this world? why should i care for someone whom i did not choose?
~~should i stand by my parents and brothers even when they are wrong? i
~~did not choose my parents, nor did i choose my sisters, should i care
~~for them? if i had not been born with the parents, would they have cared
~~for me? if i had not been the brother to my sisters, would they have
~~looked upon me the second time? out of these questions, i move towards
~~the pastures, and look towards the horizon, who am i? and the boats
~~flowing across the ocean remind me of archimedies, what if he had not
~~proposed the principle of buoyancy? looking at the train moving like a
~~city far in horizon amazes me, what if newton hadn't discovered the law
~~of momentum? but, wouldn't have trains ran, and boats swam without these
~~people pointing the principles out? oh, but they merely discovered them,
~~they weren't the one who made the laws...! the world is happening around
~~us, the boats swam even before archimedies proposed his principle, or
~~did newton propound the famous three laws, and are still doing so. can i
~~ignore these facts? can i ignore my mind discovering the presence of a
~~god that created and maintains these universe? can i ignore my heart
~~pounding at the discovery of truth? yes, so am i convinced that there is
~~god, but then would god be so unfair with his creation as to hide
~~himself from his creation, leaving them in darkness? my heart refuses,
~~my mind disagrees. PageV02P0255
# so how would he have communicated with his creation? should he come
~~down to me and prove his presence? oh but then who am i to whom god
~~should come down? my heart is speechless, my mind - blank. ok, but then
~~wouldn't he have send down some message on to the creations to disclose
~~the truth? but of course that seems logical. where are they then? so i
~~read the religions, in order to discover the truth amidst them. however,
~~the theory of multitudes of gods, or, worshipping icons soon found no
~~support either from my heart, nor from my mind. how can god be made of
~~rock, that which perishes with rain and wind? why need a second god,
~~when one can create the whole universe??? then i learned about abraham,
~~noah, yousef, muhammed amidst many others. they preached one god, and
~~strived hard for it. they risked the wrath of the tyrants of their time
~~for just a word, that there is only one god! why did they do so? did
~~they want to become kings?? oh but they led the simplest lives and died
~~the humblest man on earth. but then what is a kingdom for those who
~~recognize the owner of kingdoms!!! reading more about them through
~~various **** like bible and tohrah made me ponder on the following
~~questions: how can god be so powerless as to allow the creation to
~~crucify his so called son? how can god be so biased as to distinguish
~~amidst his own creation? how come that certain people on committing a
~~particular act are punished, whereas certain selected committing the
~~same act are salvaged? amidst all these i read the quran, that answered
~~all of the questions, and cleared all of my doubts. PageV02P0256
# it cleared the question where i started from, who am i? oh but how
~~simple is its arguments? for i am here for one god alone, to be tested,
~~so that i can be given the best, to praise him, and to love those whom
~~he loves. and yet be just, for even if my own do harm to people, i
~~punish them, and if they do good, i love them. i am with those who are
~~with truth! and i carry no distinction amidst people for their race,
~~caste or origin. and there are no partners to him, for he is alone, one
~~of his kind,and has no progeny. and is there no distinction between a
~~man and a man except of the deeds that each does! i have discovered the
~~truth, and accepted it to the fullest. i do not claim i am the judge.
~~however, i discovered the best with the reasoning that all of us use. i
~~discovered the ****** opening towards the truth. this is for you too.

# sister penomee (dr. kari ann owen, ph.d.) july 4, 1997. a salaam
~~aleikum, beloved family. "there is no god but allah, and muhammed is his
~~messenger." these are the words of the shahadah oath, i believe. the
~~creator is known by many names. his wisdom is always recognizable, and
~~his presence made manifest in the love, tolerance and compassion present
~~in our community. his profound ability to guide us from a war-like
~~individualism so rampant in american society to a belief in the glory
~~and dignity of the creator's human family, and our obligations to and
~~membership within that family. this describes the maturation of a
~~spiritual personality, and perhaps the most desirable maturation of the
~~psychological self, also. my road to shahadah began when an admired
~~director, tony richardson, died of aids. mr. richardson was already a
~~brilliant and internationally recognized professional when i almost met
~~him backstage at the play luther at age 14. playwrighting for me has
~~always been a way of finding degrees of spiritual and emotional
~~reconciliation both within myself and between myself and a world i found
~~rather brutal due to childhood circumstances. instead of fighting with
~~the world, i let my conflicts fight it out in my plays. amazingly, some
~~of us have even grown up together! so as i began accumulating stage
~~credits (productions and staged readings), beginning at age 17, i always
~~retained the hope that i would someday fulfill my childhood dream of
~~studying and working with mr. richardson. PageV02P0258
# when he followed his homosexuality to america (from england) and a
~~promiscuous community, aids killed him, and with him went another
~~portion of my sense of belonging to and within american society. i began
~~to look outside american and western society to islamic culture for
~~moral guidance. why islam and not somewhere else? my birthmother's
~~ancestors were spanish jews who lived among muslims until the
~~inquisition expelled the jewish community in 1492. in my historical
~~memory, which i feel at a deep level, the call of the muezzin is as deep
~~as the lull of the ocean and the swaying of ships, the pounding of
~~horses' hooves across the desert, the assertion of love in the face of
~~oppression. i felt the birth of a story within me, and the drama took
~~form as i began to learn of an ottoman caliph's humanity toward jewish
~~refugees at the time of my ancestors' expulsions. allah guided my
~~learning, and i was taught about islam by figures as diverse as imam
~~siddiqi of the south bay islamic association; sister hussein of rahima;
~~and my beloved adopted sister, maria abdin, who is native american and
~~muslim and a writer for the sbia magazine, iqra. my first research
~~interview was in a halal butcher shop in san francisco's mission
~~district, where my understanding of living islam was profoundly affected
~~by the first muslim lady i had ever met: a customer who was in hijab,
~~behaved with a sweet kindness and grace and also read, wrote and spoke
~~four languages. PageV02P0259
# her brilliance, coupled with her amazing (to me) freedom from
~~arrogance, had a profound effect on the beginnings of my knowledge of
~~how islam can affect human behavior. little did i know then that not
~~only would a play be born, but a new muslim. the course of my research
~~introduced me to much more about islam than a set of facts, for islam is
~~a living religion. i learned how muslims conduct themselves with a
~~dignity and kindness which lifts them above the american slave market of
~~sexual competition and violence. i learned that muslim men and women can
~~actually be in each others' presence without tearing each other to
~~pieces, verbally and physically. and i learned that modest dress,
~~perceived as a spiritual state,can uplift human behavior and grant to
~~both men and women a sense of their own spiritual worth. why did this
~~seem so astonishing, and so astonishingly new? like most american
~~females, i grew up in a slave market, comprised not only of the sexual
~~sicknesses of my family, but the constant negative judging of my
~~appearance by peers beginning at ages younger than seven. i was taught
~~from a very early age by american society that my human worth consisted
~~solely of my attractiveness (or, in my case, lack of it) to others.
~~needless to say, in this atmosphere, boys and girls, men and women,
~~often grew to resent each other very deeply, given the desperate desire
~~for peer acceptance, which seemed almost if not totally dependent not on
~~one's kindness or compassion or even intelligence, but on looks and the
~~perception of those looks by others. PageV02P0260
# while i do not expect or look for human perfection among muslims, the
~~social differences are profound, and almost unbelievable to someone like
~~myself. i do not pretend to have any answers to the conflicts of the
~~middle east, except what the prophets, beloved in islam, have already
~~expressed. my disabilities prevent me from fasting, and from praying in
~~the same prayer postures as most of you. but i love and respect the
~~islam i have come to know through the behavior and words of the men and
~~women i have come to know in amila (american muslims intent on learning
~~and activism) and elsewhere, where i find a freedom from cruel emotional
~~conflicts and a sense of imminent spirituality. what else do i feel and
~~believe about islam? i support and deeply admire islam's respect for
~~same sex education; for the rights of women as well as men in society;
~~for modest dress; and above all for sobriety and marriage, the two most
~~profound foundations of my life, for i am 21 1/2 years sober and happily
~~married. how wonderful to feel that one and half billion muslims share
~~my faith in the character development marriage allows us, and also in my
~~decision to remain drug- and alcohol-free. what, then, is islam's
~~greatest gift in a larger sense? in a society which presents us with
~~constant pressure to immolate ourselves on the altars of unbridled
~~instinct without respect for consequences, islam asks us to regard
~~ourselves as human persons created by allah with the capacity for
~~responsibility in our relations with others. PageV02P0261
# through prayer and charity and a committment to sobriety and
~~education, if we follow the path of islam, we stand a good chance of
~~raising children who will be free from the violence and exploitation
~~which is robbing parents and children of safe schools and neighborhoods,
~~and often of their lives. the support of the amila community and other
~~friends, particularly at a time of some strife on the amila net, causes
~~me to affirm my original responses to islam and declare that this is a
~~marvelous community, for in its affirmation of allah's gifts of
~~marriage, sobriety and other forms of responsiblity, islam shows us the
~~way out of hell. my husband, silas, and i are grateful for your presence
~~and your friendship. and as we prepare to lay the groundwork for
~~adoption, we hope that we will continue to be blessed with your warm
~~acceptance, for we want our child to feel the spiritual presence of
~~allah in the behavior of surrounding adults and children. we hope that
~~as other amila'ers consider becoming new parents, and become new
~~parents, a progressive islamic school might emerge... progressive
~~meaning supportive and loving as well as superior in academics, arts and
~~sports. maybe our computer whizzes will teach science and math while i
~~teach creative writing and horseback riding! please consider us
~~companions on the journey toward heaven, and please continue to look for
~~us at your gatherings, on the amila net and in the colors and dreams of
~~the sunset. PageV02P0262

~~where should i start in this story? well lets start with me getting deep
~~into christianity. i was 14, yes fourteen and really into the aspect of
~~religion, later this would prove that i was on the track of finding
~~truth. i studying and entered a christian church, yet to me there was
~~something missing. people would gossip and talk about other people and
~~act as though they forgot there were religious rituals going on, so
~~within 2 years i stopped going and just did my own thing which would
~~prove to do me more harm than good. at age 16 i got in an argument with
~~my mother and that alone got me put in the jail facility for juveniles
~~and i vowed that once i was out i would change my life and find a way to
~~help change others. yet i had no idea what this way was. the next day my
~~mother got me out and two days later we got in an argument and that day
~~i walked all the way (one mile) to the public main library to get books
~~on islam. i had been reading on malcolm x and this made me want to get
~~more into what he taught. i read a quran in english from back to back
~~and was astonished, but not knowing totally about islam i still was lost
~~and didn't even know where a masjid or mosque was. PageV02P0263
# so that was when i remembered about farrakhan a year ago and the
~~speech he gave about atonement and this got me to looking for a book on
~~that even which was the million man march and the book was an anthology
~~of that event and i read it and copied the noi address. so after a weak
~~i got a letter and called the local mosque 91 here in toledo, ohio and
~~got into there teachings as fast and easy as i could but still something
~~was not right. i would be on the corner selling papers instead of
~~completely studying islam. i had to basically learn how to pray on my
~~own. they did get into shahadah and jumah prayer and other things but
~~they did it their own way contrary to the quran. but even while knowing
~~this i stayed in it for 3 years thinking it was right, then i left and
~~stopped completely and just read the quran and adhered to it leaving
~~elijah's books and teachings behind. then this year i began to re-read
~~the quran and now i feel (mash'allah) the full meaning of what it is to
~~be muslim. yet i have not gone to a masjid yet tommorow i definitely
~~(inshallah) will go to this masjid and then eventually i will get into
~~and perform shahadah. i really don't care who accepts my change in
~~religion. i feel that if anyone accepted me as a racist noi member then
~~surely they will accept me as a real true muslim who accepts and loves
~~those who love me regardless of race, gender, creed, class, handicapp
~~etc etc. allah has brought me on the right path and i hope that,
~~inshallah, it brings more people to the right path which is al-islam.

~~before i tell you my journey to islam, here's some background
~~information you might like to know. i'm a 15 year old caucasian male who
~~lives in nw indiana. i go to a catholic high school, in which i'm a
~~sophomore. the city i live in (whiting) is small; about 5,150 people,
~~i'm the only muslim. and now, the story... my journey to islam wasn't
~~like a lot of people's. i didn't meet any muslims personally, nor did i
~~get to witness such events as sister jahida. my journey, however, is
~~interesting in its own right. it started in late 1998, about august. i
~~was about to start high school, and i was, like most people are, quite
~~nervous. i was largely nervous because a priest would be teaching my
~~theology class. i only had a problem because i wasn't very religious.
~~anyway, our class got to talking about the world's religions in general,
~~and islam came up. i was chosen to do a report on it, and it was ironic
~~that on that very night i saw a tv program on jihad. (of course, it was
~~all wrong) so i researched and researched, and i found myself doing
~~extra work; not for a better grade, but because i was greatly interested
~~in it. one day, a group of friends and myself went to downtown chicago
~~for the day. i thought it would be a good place to find literature on
~~islam, so i bought a qur'an. masha'allah that i did. it's utterly
~~amazing. PageV02P0265
# i read surah al-qadr when i first opened it to a random spot, and
~~though it is short in words, it left a lasting impression on me. fall
~~turned into winter, and winter to spring. all this time, i've been
~~wavering if i should take my shahadah. my parents wouldn't take this
~~well, i thought. so that was a big concern of mine. also, i'd be the
~~only muslim in the community and school. was i ready? was i ready for
~~the struggle and fight ahead of me if i chose islam? yes, i was,
~~alhumdulillah. on may 10th, 1999, at the age of 14, i took my shahada.
~~it's been just over 6 months, subhan'allah, and i can't think of
~~changing a thing. although it would be nice if i could tell my mother,
~~i'm still trying to figure out how and when, and i pray that i will know
~~soon, insha'allah. my father, with whom i don't live, knows and is very
~~accepting of it. insha'allah my first ramadan will be a memorable one,

# shariffa carlo the story of how i reverted to al islam is a story of
~~plans. i made plans, the group i was with made plans, and allah made
~~plans. and allah is the best of planners. when i was a teenager, i came
~~to the attention of a group of people with a very sinister agenda. they
~~were and probably still are a loose association of individuals who work
~~in government positions but have a special agenda - to destroy islam. it
~~is not a governmental group that i am aware of, they simply use their
~~positions in the us government to advance their cause. one member of
~~this group approached me because he saw that i was articulate, motivated
~~and very much the women's rights advocate. he told me that if i studied
~~international relations with an emphasis in the middle east, he would
~~guarantee me a job at the american embassy in egypt. he wanted me to
~~eventually go there to use my position in the country to talk to muslim
~~women and encourage the fledgling women's rights movement. i thought
~~this was a great idea. i had seen the muslim women on tv; i knew they
~~were a poor oppressed group, and i wanted to lead them to the light of
~~20th century freedom. with this intention, i went to college and began
~~my education. i studied quraan, hadith and islamic history. i also
~~studied the ways i could use this information. i learned how to twist
~~the words to say what i wanted them to say. it was a valuable tool. once
~~i started learning, however, i began to be intrigued by this message. it
~~made sense. that was very scary. PageV02P0267
# therefore, in order to counteract this effect, i began to take classes
~~in christianity. i chose to take classes with this one professor on
~~campus because he had a good reputation and he had a ph.d. in theology
~~from harvard university. i felt i was in good hands. i was, but not for
~~the reasons i thought. it turns out that this professor was a unitarian
~~christian. he did not believe in the trinity or the divinity of jesus.
~~in actuality, he believed that jesus was a prophet. he proceeded to
~~prove this by taking the bible from its sources in greek, hebrew and
~~aramaic and show where they were changed. as he did this, he showed the
~~historical events which shaped and followed these changes. by the time i
~~finished this class, my deen had been destroyed, but i was still not
~~ready to accept islam. as time went on, i continued to study, for myself
~~and for my future career. this took about three years. in this time, i
~~would question muslims about their beliefs. one of the individuals i
~~questioned was a muslim brother with the msa. alhamdulillah, he saw my
~~interest in the deen, and made it a personal effort to educate me about
~~islam. may allah increase his reward. he would give me dawaa at every
~~opportunity which presented itself. one day, this man contacts me, and
~~he tells me about a group of muslims who were visiting in town. he
~~wanted me to meet them. i agreed. i went to meet with them after ishaa
~~prayer. i was led to a room with at least 20 men in it. they all made
~~space for me to sit, and i was placed face to face with an elderly
~~pakistani gentleman. PageV02P0268
# mashallah, this brother was a very knowledgeable man in matters of
~~christianity. he and i discussed and argued the varying parts of the
~~bible and the quraan until the fajr. at this point, after having
~~listened to this wise man tell me what i already knew, based on the
~~class i had taken in christianity, he did what no other individual had
~~ever done. he invited me to become a muslim. in the three years i had
~~been searching and researching, no one had ever invited me. i had been
~~taught, argued with and even insulted, but never invited. may allah
~~guide us all. so when he invited me, it clicked. i realized this was the
~~time. i knew it was the truth, and i had to make a decision.
~~alhamdulillah, allah opened my heart, and i said, "yes. i want to be a
~~muslim." with that, the man led me in the shahadah - in english and in
~~arabic. i swear by allah that when i took the shahadah, i felt the
~~strangest sensation. i felt as if a huge, physical weight had just been
~~lifted off my chest; i gasped for breath as if i were breathing for the
~~first time in my life. alhamdulillah, allah had given me a new life - a
~~clean slate - a chance for jennah, and i pray that i live the rest of my
~~days and die as a muslim. ameen. shariffa a carlo (al andalusia) source

# rob wicks [in the following article, "noi" refers to the nation of
~~islam, which in spite of its name, is a group far removed from islam.
~~-ed.] i grew up baptist, in a family of ministers, in rural mississippi.
~~i went to college at morehouse college in atlanta, so i was exposed to
~~the noi, but i had the good fortune to become friends with an orthodox
~~muslim who explained to me the difference between noi and islam, and the
~~lack of knowledge most noi have of true islam. later, after i left
~~school and began working, i got an internet account, and started to
~~study some of the religions of the world. i had never really been a
~~particularly religious person, due to my somewhat scientific nature. i
~~always insist on proof. i started to delve deeper into christianity, and
~~studied it intently on the web. i was somewhat disdained however by some
~~inconsistencies in the bible. i principally was troubled by the trinity,
~~though. i just did not see it. the one passage i saw as being most
~~supportive (1 john 5:7) was partially forged. when i read mathew
~~19:16-17, and jesus (pbuh) says "why callest thou me good?, it was clear
~~to me that he was saying that he was not good, and only god was. but
~~most of the christians seemed to think jesus was being tongue-in-cheek
~~at this point. i found that i would have to be dishonest to accept this.
~~then fortune? smiled upon me. i hit a deer in my car. it was out of
~~service for almost a month. during that time, i was unemployed, but had
~~saved money, so i could live (i also have two roommates). i still had my
~~internet account, and i decided to study more. PageV02P0270
# after i had studied the biblical contradictions, in addition to the
~~inherent idolatry and un******ural nature of the trinity, along with
~~other things, i rejected christianity as a religion. even jesus did not
~~seem to teach it, he taught belief in god. i went a time without any
~~religion, thinking maybe it was all a sham. i have a friend who is in
~~the 5% noi, and i saw how much he hated religion, and i decided that i
~~did not want to be like that. i believe that god kept my mind open and
~~my heart from hardening against him, and i studied islam. everything
~~just seemed to fit: a reasoned faith which was very prayerful to keep us
~~on the straight path, yet did not disdain acquisition of knowledge (the
~~preachers back home loved to rail against education, as if ignorance is
~~preferred by god). islam seemed to be made for me. a good muslim was the
~~exact sort of person i aspired to be. after another month of study and
~~prayer, i decided that if muhammad (pbuh) was not a prophet, then there
~~had never been prophets in the first place. the moment of decision came
~~one night when i was reading the qur'an and i read 21:30, and i read of
~~god expanding his creation. now, i almost became an astronomer at one
~~point, and i still am interested, and these verses hit me like a
~~sledgehammer. i became fearful of god, and wanted to worship him better.

# erin/sumaya fannoun april 12, 1998. bismillah arahman araheem my
~~intention in writing my story is that for allah's sake, i may help
~~someone who is searching for the truth, to realize that they have found
~~it in al islam. i began writing this on easter sunday, kind of
~~appropriate, i think. i have been muslim now for seven years, alhamdu
~~lillah (all praise is for allah, [god]). i first learned of islam while
~~attending university, from a muslim friend of mine. i had managed to get
~~out of a very good, college-prep high school believing that the qur'an
~~was a jewish book, and that muslims were idol worshipping pagans. i was
~~not interested in learning about a new religion. i held the ethnocentric
~~view that if since the us was "#1", we must have the best of everything,
~~including religion. i knew that christianity wasn't perfect, but
~~believed that it was the best that there was. i had long held the
~~opinion that although the bible contained the word of god, it also
~~contained the word of the common man, who wrote it down. as allah would
~~have it, every time i had picked up the bible in my life, i had come
~~across some really strange and actually dirty passages. i could not
~~understand why the prophets of god would do such abominable things when
~~there are plenty of average people who live their whole lives without
~~thinking of doing such disgusting and immoral things, such as those
~~attributed to prophets david, solomon, and lot, (peace be upon them all)
~~just to name a few. PageV02P0272
# i remember hearing in church that since these prophets commit such
~~sins, how could the common people be any better than them? and so, it
~~was said, jesus had to be sacrificed for our sins, because we just
~~couldn't help ourselves, as the "flesh is weak". so, i wrestled with the
~~notion of the trinity, trying to understand how my god was not one, but
~~three. one who created the earth, one whose blood was spilled for our
~~sins, and then there was the question of the holy ghost, yet all one and
~~the same!? when i would pray to god, i had a certain image in my mind of
~~a wise old man in flowing robe, up in the clouds. when i would pray to
~~jesus, i pictured a young white man with long golden hair, beard and
~~blue eyes. as for the holy spirit, well, i could only conjure up a misty
~~creature whose purpose i wasn't sure of. it really didn't feel as though
~~i was praying to one god. i found though that when i was really in a
~~tight spot, i would automatically call directly on god. i knew
~~inherently, that going straight to god, was the best bet. when i began
~~to research and study islam, i didn't have a problem with praying to god
~~directly, it seemed the natural thing to do. however, i feared forsaking
~~jesus, and spent a lot of time contemplating the subject. i began to
~~study the christian history, searching for the truth. PageV02P0273
# the more i looked into it, the more i saw the parallel between the
~~deification and sacrifice of jesus, and the stories of greek mythology
~~that i had learned in junior high, where a god and a human woman would
~~produce a child which would be a demigod, possessing some attributes of
~~a god. i learned of how important it had been to "st. paul", to have
~~this religion accepted by the greeks to whom he preached, and how some
~~of the disciples had disagreed with his methods. it seemed very probable
~~that this could have been a more appealing form of worship to the greeks
~~than the strict monotheism of the old testament. and only allah knows. i
~~began to have certain difficulties with christian thought while still in
~~high school. two things bothered me very much. the first was the direct
~~contradiction between material in the old and new testaments. i had
~~always thought of the ten commandments as very straight forward, simple
~~rules that god obviously wanted us to follow. yet, worshipping christ,
~~was breaking the first commandment completely and totally, by
~~associating a partner with god. i could not understand why an omniscient
~~god would change his mind, so to speak. then there is the question of
~~repentance. in the old testament, people are told to repent for their
~~sins; but in the new testament, it is no longer necessary, as christ was
~~sacrificed for the sins of the people. "paul did not call upon his
~~hearers to repent of particular sins, but rather announced god's victory
~~over all sin in the cross of christ. PageV02P0274
# the radical nature of god's power is affirmed in paul's insistence
~~that in the death of christ god has rectified the ungodly (see romans
~~4:5). human beings are not called upon to do good works in order that
~~god may rectify them." so what incentive did we even have to be good,
~~when being bad could be a lot of fun? society has answered by redefining
~~good and bad. any childcare expert will tell you that children must
~~learn that their actions have consequences, and they encourage parents
~~to allow them to experience the natural consequences of their actions.
~~yet in christianity, there are no consequences, so people have begun to
~~act like spoiled children. demanding the right to do as they please,
~~demanding god's and peoples' unconditional love and acceptance of even
~~vile behavior. it is no wonder that our prisons are over-flowing, and
~~that parents are at a loss to control their children. that is not to say
~~that in islam we believe that we get to heaven based on our deeds, on
~~the contrary, the prophet muhammad (peace be upon him) told us that we
~~will only enter paradise through god's mercy, as evidenced in the
~~following hadith. narrated 'aisha: the prophet said, "do good deeds
~~properly, sincerely and moderately, and receive good news because one's
~~good deeds will not make him enter paradise." they asked, "even you, o
~~allah's apostle?" he said, "even i, unless and until allah bestows his
~~pardon and mercy on me." so in actuality, i did not even know who god
~~was. PageV02P0275
# if jesus was not a separate god, but really part of god, then who was
~~he sacrificed to? and who was he praying to in the garden of gethsemane?
~~if he was separate in nature from god, then you have left the realm of
~~monotheism, which is also in direct contradiction to the teachings of
~~the old testament. it was so confusing, that i preferred not to think of
~~it, and had begun to thoroughly resent the fact that i could not
~~understand my own religion. that point was brought home when i began to
~~discuss religion with my future husband at college. he asked me to
~~explain the trinity to him. after several failed attempts at getting him
~~to understand it, i threw my hands up in frustration, and claimed that i
~~couldn't explain it well because, "i am not a scholar!" to which he
~~calmly replied, "do you have to be a scholar to understand the basis of
~~your religion?" ouch!, that really hurt; but the truth hurts sometimes.
~~by that point, i had tired of the mental acrobatics required to
~~contemplate who i was actually worshipping. i grudgingly listened while
~~he told me of the oneness of god, and that he had not changed his mind,
~~but completed his message to mankind through the prophet muhammad,
~~allah's peace and blessings be upon him. i had to admit, it made sense.
~~god had sent prophets in succession to mankind for centuries, because
~~they obviously kept going astray, and needed guidance. even at that
~~point, i told him that he could tell me about his religion, just for my
~~general information. PageV02P0276
# "but don't try to convert me", i told him, "because you'll never do
~~it!" "no", he said, "i just want you to understand where i'm coming from
~~and it is my duty as a muslim to tell you." and of course, he didn't
~~convert me; but rather, allah guided me to his truth. alhamdu lillah. at
~~about the same time, a friend of mine gave me a "translation" of the
~~qur'an in english that she found at a book store. she had no way of
~~knowing that this book was actually written by an iraqi jew for the
~~purpose of driving people away from islam, not for helping them to
~~understand it. it was very confusing. i circled and marked all the
~~passages that i wanted to ask my muslim friend about and when he
~~returned from his trip abroad, i accosted him with my questions, book in
~~hand. he could not tell from the translation that it was supposed to be
~~the qur'an, and patiently informed me of the true meaning of the verses
~~and the conditions under which they were revealed. he found a good
~~translation of the meaning of the qur'an for me to read, which i did. i
~~still remember sitting alone, reading it, looking for errors, and
~~questioning. the more i read, the more i became convinced that this book
~~could only have one source, god. i was reading about god's mercy and his
~~willingness to forgive any sin, except the sin of associating partners
~~with him; and i began to weep. i cried from the depth of my soul. i
~~cried for my past ignorance and in joy of finally finding the truth. i
~~knew that i was forever changed. PageV02P0277
# i was amazed at the scientific knowledge in the qur'an, which is not
~~taken from the bible as some would have you believe. i was getting my
~~degree in microbiology at that time, and was particularly impressed with
~~the de******ion of the embryological process, and so much more. once i
~~was sure that this book was truly from god, i decided that i had to
~~accept islam as my religion. i knew it wouldn't be easy, but nothing
~~worthwhile ever is. i learned that the first and most important step of
~~becoming muslim is to believe in "la illaha il allah, wa muhammad
~~arasool allah", meaning that there is no god worthy of worship except
~~allah, and that muhammad is the messenger of allah. after i understood
~~that jesus was sent as a prophet, to show the jews that they were going
~~astray, and bring them back to the path of god, i had no trouble with
~~the concept of worshipping god alone. but i did not know who muhammad
~~was, and didn't understand what it really meant to follow him. may allah
~~bless all those people who have helped me to understand and appreciate
~~the life of the prophet muhammad, (peace be upon him), throughout these
~~last seven years. i learned that allah sent him as an example to
~~mankind. an example to be followed and imitated by all of us in our
~~daily lives. he was in his behaviors, the qur'an exemplified. may allah
~~guide us all to live as he taught us. source

# jihad mujahid abdul salaam (usa) assalamu 'alaikum wa rahmatullah wa
~~barakatu! as the calender passes and ramadan quickly approaches, i am
~~reminded of my first ramadan, but more importantly, the day and the
~~reason i took shahadatain. as a great majority of americans, i was
~~raised by my family as a christian, but could not and did not find it
~~satisfying. too many questions were left unanswered, especially after
~~"church services" on sunday when i would see the deacons and the
~~"seniors" coming out of the liquor store with "brown bags" wrapped tight
~~in their hands. when i was old enough to make choices for myself, i
~~stopped going to church altogether. this left me with a spiritual void
~~which i wallowed in for many, many years. i joined the army and spent 15
~~years there. while serving, i was introduced to "freemasonry" and though
~~it would assist in filing my spiritual void. need i give the results?
~~after i was honorably discharged from the military, i moved to
~~california where a chain of events transpired that changed my entire
~~outlook on life. for some reason, i made the decision to revert to my
~~childhood ways and began to take drugs and run with the wrong crowd.
~~this decision took me to the wretched bowels of this society. i became
~~addicted to drugs and alcohol, the evil ways of the street life and
~~homeless. i even ended up in the county jail quite a few times for
~~crimes i committed to "support" this wicked way of life. PageV02P0279
# due to the mercy of allah (swt)[and at that time i did not know it was
~~his mercy, i thought it was the "god' wearing the black robe sitting
~~above all in he courtroom] i survived those treacherous years in the la
~~county jail. but that was not enough of a wake up call for me to change
~~my suicidal ways. i "graduated" to more serious crimes which ended me in
~~state prison for quite a few years collectively. my last sentence
~~(1994-1999) was the blessing from allah (swt) i recognized!!!! you see,
~~i qualified for the 3 strikes law: 25 to life. the public defender the
~~court assigned to me negotiated a deal with the prosecutor for a 18 year
~~sentence, which i would have to serve 80 % of. i could not see myself
~~serving 16-17 years for shop lifting two tee-shirts ($48.00 total), so i
~~fired the attorney and exercised my right to represent myself (pro-per).
~~when i returned from court to the county jail, i walked into the cell
~~block and observed a brother performing salah. i was immobilized, i
~~could not move. i stood there and watched this brother until he
~~completed his salah. i then approached him and asked about what he was
~~was doing. we talked for almost 4 hours!!!! the more this brother spoke
~~the more hungry i became, until finally i asked how do you become
~~muslim!?!?! the guard was making his rounds and ordered us to shut up.
~~the very next morning i was awakened by the guard and transferred to the
~~pro-per module in order to prepare for my case. PageV02P0280
# when i arrived a brother named siyeed welcomed me and told me dawud
~~(the brother who was doing salah) had informed him of my interest in al-
~~islam. brother siyeed gave me a qur'an and a book entitled: "the beliefs
~~and teachings of islam". i studied these books during my free moments,
~~for i had my life to fight for, not knowing that allah (swt) had taken
~~over it. then one day i hear brother siyeed, in a loud voice ask another
~~brother to call the azahn. i heard the most beautiful sound come from
~~this brother's mouth!!! after the azahn, bro. siyeed informed all on the
~~cell block that it was time for the muslims to do their prayers and we
~~would appreciate if the non-muslims would lower their voices and noise
~~until we finished. not being a stranger to convicts way of life, i just
~~knew there was going to be a fight. how wrong i was!!!!!! they all said:
~~go ahead brothers!!! it was then i was introduced to the community. mind
~~you we were locked in one man cells and had no way to see or touch each
~~other. the iqama was called and bro. siyeed lead this most moving prayer
~~i ever heard, in arabic. after chow , i sent a not to siyeed and told
~~him i was ready to be muslim. if words like he spoke during prayer could
~~make tears come from my eyes, then i wanted to cry forever!!! i declared
~~my faith and became a member of the jam'at, but most importantly of the
~~umm'ah. PageV02P0281
# this story continues with more hardships (trials), but as i studied
~~and prayed, allah (swt) paved the way for me to fight my case for six
~~months and reduce 2 of the strikes, i was sentenced to 5 years!!! allah
~~(swt) blessed me with the ability to represent myself and the results
~~were to my favor. it really was never a question as to my guilt or
~~innocence, it was a question of the punishment equaling the crime. i
~~spent those years in some of the most horrendous, violent and corrupted

# mr samir my conversion to islam has been intellectual and emotional.
~~my parents have both been educated at the university-level. my mother is
~~a christian convert (she was atheist), and my father has personal
~~beliefs. my family is rather rich. ever since i was very young, i've
~~been interested by political questions. i enjoyed reading history books,
~~although i was confused a little bit between military history and
~~politics. i called myself a communist, but today i wouldn't say i knew
~~what it means. over time, i learned real politics and sociology, but
~~when the communist bloc fell, i admitted my error and was no longer a
~~fan of the communist states. i became agnostic, and thought that all
~~human beings are condemned to egotism and to ignorance of some
~~questions, like the existence of god. i learned philosophy. i wanted to
~~avoid doing the same mistakes as in the past, and so i refused all
~~dogmas. at this time occured the separation of my parents, and also
~~other personal problems. to forget all this, i spent a lot of time in
~~laughing with (fake) friends, drinking, and then smoking cigarettes,
~~then hash. i sometimes took hard drugs (heroin, lsd, and some other
~~poisons). despite this, i passed my baccalaureat (this is an exam that
~~ends four years of college and gives the right to continue graduate
~~level study at the university). by chance, i had to go at the army (we
~~do not have the choice in the country i live in). the strict rules i
~~could not avoid there were a very good thing for me; also, i was tired
~~enough to enjoy simple things as eating and sleeping. PageV02P0283
# alhamdulillah (praise be to god), my mentality changed. back in civil
~~society, i spent one more dark year: i always had the temptation of my
~~bad habits, and i felt that life was very superficial after the big
~~efforts and the friendship of the army. i began feeling the necessity of
~~something else in my life. then one of my sisters, back from a journey
~~to syria, gave me a book. this book, written in my language, is a gift
~~she received there. its author, who had titled it "the bible, quran and
~~science", wanted to show that there are in the quran some things that
~~were simply impossible for a human being to know at the time the quran
~~was revealed. conclusion: the authenticity of the quran is proved,
~~scientifically proved. the first thing i thought after having read the
~~book was: "oh! it would be super!" -- i was ready for a change in my way
~~of life. i bought a translation of the quran to compare. before having
~~entirely read it, i had become a muslim, alhamdulillah. as you can see,
~~a psychologist wouldn't have any problem to explain what he would call
~~my choice. for me, all things come from god and he had written this for
~~me, he had chosen these means to make me accept islam. alhamdulillah!
~~what no psychologist can see is what happens in my heart when i read the
~~quran: faith has little to do with what one feels in front of a
~~scientific demonstration! source http://newmuslims.tk/ 23- tena

# tena both my husband and i converted to islam. i converted during
~~ramadan last year and my husband shortly after. the thing that drew me
~~to islam was the hijab and loose clothing of the muslim women. we both
~~did research by internet and then read ahadith. i was totally convinced.
~~i went to a masjid for my first time. a sister there greeted me and gave
~~me my first hijab which i will cherish always. i watched on as others
~~prayed...too scared that if i participated i might offend someone ...but
~~not realizing that they would soon become my brothers and sisters in
~~islam alhamdulillah. after i converted i did not wear hijab right away.
~~it wasn't until a year after that i did. i found the right one to fit my
~~head and also the right spot in my heart to wear it. now i don't go out
~~without it . my husband read the qu'ran and then shortly after
~~converted. myself i'm from a canadian anglican background and my husband
~~never joined his christian church (presbyterian). our parents are
~~dealing with it slowly. i've never had any bad experience when
~~converting to islam. i hope that by wearing hijab that i will prompt
~~someone to research it too. i've met wonderful people in my walk in

# themise cruz if anyone were to ask me when i became muslim, i guess
~~the only feasible answer would be that i was born muslim, but just
~~wasn't aware of it. we are all born into a state of islam, but what is
~~unfortunate is that many people never recognize this fact, and live lost
~~in other circles of religion and lifestyles. i was horribly lost, and i
~~suppose this was a good thing, because allah felt my suffering and
~~reached out to me. (al humd dulilah) my first introduction to islam was
~~through a course at the university where during ramadan we were invited
~~to juma prayer. it was here where i met a wonderful muslim sister who
~~invited me to her home for study and food. i declined at the time
~~because it seemed too foreign to me. i had built up so many stereotypes
~~that i was not willing to open my mind to anything surrounding islam,
~~even an invitation to knowledge. the next message allah sent me came by
~~my friendship with several arab muslims at one of the technical colleges
~~near my home. this is where i was exposed to the islamic lifestyle. i
~~was amazed at the fact that they refused invitations to wild parties and
~~drinking alcohol. how could they sit and pray so many times a day. and
~~fasting for a whole month, what had gotten into these people? from that
~~point forward, i thought i was the american authority on islam. but in
~~actuality i knew nothing. the height of my confusion hit at this point.
~~i was an observer, but never had any understanding of what it all meant.
~~PageV02P0286
# so, when i became a muslim it was like allah found me and gave me the
~~answers to all the confusion that ran around in my head. it is so mind
~~boggling to me that i was oblivious to the fact that i was so miserable.
~~i was successful in the material aspects of life, but my mind and heart
~~were uneasy. i was so weak in spirit that i tricked myself in believing
~~that the material things that laid at my feet, were enough to cushion
~~any hurtful blow that life dealt me. i was wrong. my mother died when i
~~was 23, and all the money, my home, my education, the cars, jewelry,
~~they all meant nothing. i tried to go on with life as though her death
~~was just another event. but it was at this point that i could no longer
~~ignore allah. if i went on in my current state of mind, then my mother's
~~life had been in vain. what purpose did she serve here on this earth? to
~~what greater significance did her life have in this world? i could not
~~believe that she meant so little. it was at this point that i began to
~~hunger for this knowledge, and i opened all of myself to allah. it is
~~almost too difficult to describe what it is like for someone who begins
~~to feel allah in their heart. islam means so much more than rituals,
~~language, culture or country. islam is a glorious state of being, and it
~~is a fundamentally different experience than what i had previously been
~~learning. my husband taught me much of what i know about islam today.
~~while observing, listening and opening my heart, i slowly began to
~~understand. PageV02P0287
# allah presents himself to people in different ways, and allah impacts
~~everyone's life differently. i had to come to an understanding of what
~~allah meant to me, and why it was necessary that i follow this path of
~~life. i began to learn the meaning and significance behind the rituals i
~~had only before observed at a primitive level. i began to read koran for
~~hours at a time. allah began to reach out to me and fill the vast hole
~~that was in my heart. for when an individual does not follow the path of
~~allah, they are in a constant search for that missing element. and once
~~i stopped refusing the knowledge of islam and opened my heart to my
~~fellow muslims and the teachings of the koran, the transition was as
~~easy as eating a piece of pecan pie. since then i have had contact with
~~the original muslim sister who i met in my university class. many of the
~~muslim sisters get together once a month for study, prayer and
~~informational sessions. i also visit the masghed during juma prayers and
~~any other time that my schedule permits. of course my husband and myself
~~study koran and hadith, and are on a constant quest for knowledge. when
~~you become a muslim it is the beginning of a new path, a new way of
~~life. everyday allah reveals himself to me in some way. sometimes it is
~~with a new piece of knowledge, or maybe he grants me patience or
~~understanding, and some days it is perseverance or a peaceful state of
~~mind. PageV02P0288
# no matter what the case i am always aware of the blessings that allah
~~presents to me, and i continuously work to live the way he has intended
~~all of us as human beings to live, in submission to his will. i have
~~also struggled throughout this search. my family is not accepting of my
~~new way of life, nor are they accepting of my husband. i had a co-worker
~~ask me one time, "how can you abandon jesus, i love jesus?" my response
~~confused her i am sure. i simply explained that in islam we abandon
~~nobody. and in fact it is only now that i can read and understand the
~~true significance of jesus. islam allows the follower to study the
~~messages that allah has sent throughout the ages, through the teachings
~~of jesus, abraham and mohammed. (peace and blessings be upon them)
~~because of this fact, as muslims, knowledge is never hidden from us, and
~~we are free in our search for truth and closeness to allah. my struggle
~~is far from over. western culture is not accepting or understanding of
~~islam, and it is mostly out of ignorance that this is so. they think
~~that we are fundamentalists or terrorists, or some other form of monster
~~here to wreak havoc in a peaceful christian world. the way in which i
~~combat the unkind comments and glares is through kindness and
~~understanding. i remember a point when my understanding was so low that
~~i closed my mind and heart to anything that the muslim community had to
~~say. and to think that if they had turned me away because of my
~~ignorance, i would not be where i am today. PageV02P0289
# so it is up to all muslims to have patience and compassion for those
~~who do not understand our way of life. eventually allah reveals himself
~~to those who seek true knowledge and understanding. february 27, 1997

# michael yip june 23, 1996 i was introduced to islam in 1995 by an
~~egyptian classmate who arrived in new zealand the previous year, and who
~~was placed into my chemistry class. i had no religion before this,
~~though i guess i was a non practicing christian, since i attended sunday
~~school when i was young, (but mainly to learn chinese, my native tongue,
~~rather than religion). in fact i was uninterested in much that was
~~taught to me, however i never at any stage discounted the notion of a
~~higher being (ie. allah, or god). because of my background in religion,
~~i did not know much about religions other than christianity and
~~buddhism. my parents are buddhists, but my knowledge of it was so weak
~~that i did not even know the proper name for their religion until a few
~~years ago. so i was naive when i met my classmate, muhammed. during the
~~first few weeks, another classmate of mine kept teasing muhammed about
~~his religion, asking leading questions and the like. i thus became
~~interested in some of the things that this other classmate, james, was
~~suggesting. so i got talking with muhammed about this religion called
~~islam, and we became acquainted quickly. i requested to see a quran but
~~did not find the time to read it, during a busy school year. so when the
~~workload became a bit lighter, i went to see my friend's father, who is
~~our local imam. he spoke to me at length about islam, and planted a seed
~~which in a few months time, with the blessing of allah, blossomed into
~~strong muslim, alhumdulillah. i took shahada in november 1995. i am
~~often asked why i came to islam. PageV02P0291
# the question seems logical, and simple, but in fact, i still find it
~~the most difficult question to answer, even though i have been asked it
~~so many times. you see, i saw many things in islam that i liked.
~~included in this were the strong brotherhood and sisterhood in islam,
~~the way fellow muslims looked after each other, and the logic in islam.
~~the logic in women wearing hijab to deter from that which is haram, the
~~logic in the forbidding of alcohol, which harms more than it ever will
~~heal, and the logic in many other areas of our lives. i have been told
~~that many people who revert to islam find they fit right in with the
~~religion. indeed this was the case with me. coming from a kafir country
~~such as new zealand (i have lived here most of my life), it is rare for
~~a person to be good religiously like myself, alhumdulillah, masha allah.
~~you see, alhumdulillah, i made intentions in my heart never to drink in
~~my life, and never have; i made intentions not to fornicate, even though
~~everyone around me in school was either fornicating or planning to. so
~~you see, alhumdulillah, allah blessed me from the beginning, and i felt
~~islam was the next obvious step for me to take in my life. i decided in
~~november of 1995, with the encouragement with some brothers and sisters
~~on the internet, to take shahada as a first step in islam, and then take
~~further steps to learn more about islam, after all we are all in a
~~constant state of learning about islam. alhumdulillah since then i have
~~progressed slowly but surely, learning some surats from quran during a
~~very busy school year. PageV02P0292
# allah blessed me with some amazing results last year, alhumdulillah,
~~and now i want to thank my allah by increasing the time i spend learning
~~quran and about islam this year, insha allah, while i pursue entry into
~~a medical degree. may allah give me the strength insha allah to enter
~~medical school next year. may allah help us all to learn more about
~~islam, and let us all undertake to live our lives in the correct way,
~~and follow the one true and surely straight path, that of islam. ameen.

# yahiye adam gadahn my first seventeen years have been a bit different
~~than the youth experienced by most americans. i grew up on an extremely
~~rural goat ranch in western riverside county, california, where my
~~family raises on average 150 to 200 animals for milk, cheese, and meat.
~~my father is a halal butcher [a butcher who slaughters in an islamic
~~manner -ed.] and supplies to an islamic food mart a few blocks from the
~~islamic center in downtown los angeles. my father was raised agnostic or
~~atheist, but he became a believer in one god when he picked up a bible
~~left on the beach. he once had a number of muslim friends, but they've
~~all moved out of california now. my mother was raised catholic, so she
~~leans towards christianity (although she, like my father, disregards the
~~trinity). i and my siblings were/are home-schooled, and as you may know,
~~most home-school families are christian. in the last 8 or so years, we
~~have been involved with some home-schooling support groups, thus
~~acquainting me with fundamentalist christianity. it was an eye-opening
~~experience. setting aside the blind dogmatism and charismatic wackiness,
~~it was quite a shock to me when i realized that these people, in their
~~prayers, were actually praying to jesus. you see, i had always believed
~~that jesus (pbuh) was, at the very most, the son of god (since that is
~~what the bible mistranslates "servant of god" as). as i learned that
~~belief in the trinity, something i find absolutely ridiculous, is
~~considered by most christians to be a prerequisite for salvation, i
~~gradually realized i could not be a christian. PageV02P0294
# in the meantime, i had become obsessed with demonic heavy ****l music,
~~something the rest of my family (as i now realize, rightfully so) was
~~not happy with. my entire life was focused on expanding my music
~~collection. i eschewed personal cleanliness and let my room reach an
~~unbelievable state of disarray. my relationship with my parents became
~~strained, although only intermittently so. i am sorry even as i write
~~this. earlier this year, i began to listen to the apocalyptic ramblings
~~of christian radio's "prophecy experts." their paranoid espousal of
~~various conspiracy theories, rabid support of israel and religious
~~zionism, and fiery preaching about the "islamic threat" held for me a
~~strange fascination. why? well, i suppose it was simply the need i was
~~feeling to fill that void i had created for myself. in any case, i soon
~~found that the beliefs these evangelists held, such as original sin and
~~the infallibility of "god's word", were not in agreement with my
~~theological ideas (not to mention the bible) and i began to look for
~~something else to hold onto. the turning point, perhaps, was when i
~~moved in with my grandparents here in santa ana, the county seat of
~~orange, california. my grandmother, a computer whiz, is hooked up to
~~america online and i have been scooting the information superhighway
~~since january. but when i moved in, with the intent of finding a job
~~(easier said than done), i begin to visit the religion folders on aol
~~and the usenet newsgroups, where i found discussions on islam to be the
~~most intriguing. PageV02P0295
# you see, i discovered that the beliefs and practices of this religion
~~fit my personal theology and intellect as well as basic human logic.
~~islam presents god not as an anthropomorphic being but as an entity
~~beyond human comprehension, transcendent of man, independant and
~~undivided. islam has a holy book that is comprehensible to a layman, and
~~there is no papacy or priesthood that is considered infallible in
~~matters of interpretation: all muslims are free to reflect and interpret
~~the book given a sufficient education. islam does not believe that all
~~men are doomed to hell unless they simply accept that god (apparently
~~unable to forgive otherwise) magnanimously allowed himself to be
~~tortured on a cross to enable him to forgive all human beings who just
~~believe that he allowed himself to be tortured on a cross... islam does
~~not believe in a chosen race. and on and on... as i began reading
~~english translations of the qur'an, i became more and more convinced of
~~the truth and authenticity of allah's teachings contained in those 114
~~chapters. having been around muslims in my formative years, i knew well
~~that they were not the bloodthirsty, barbaric terrorists that the news
~~media and the televangelists paint them to be. perhaps this knowledge
~~led me to continue my personal research further than another person
~~would have. i can't say when i actually decided that islam was for me.
~~it was really a natural progression. in any case, last week [november
~~1995 -ed.] PageV02P0296
# i went to the islamic society of orange county in garden grove and
~~told the brother in charge of the library i wanted to be a muslim. he
~~gave me some excellent reading material, and last friday i took shahada

# malik assalamalaikum brothers and sisters and non muslims. first off
~~all, i would like to start by saying that this true story is not for my
~~own fame or admiration but for the sake of my lord and your lord allah.
~~all praises due to allah, the lord of the worlds, the beneficent, the
~~merciful owner of the day of judgement. i would like to repeat to you
~~something i heard: the journey of a thousand miles has to start with the
~~first step and this is the first part of my journey. my name is malik
~~mohammed hassan and i have recently converted to islam. when i was in
~~junior high school i was first introduced to islam by reading the book
~~roots by alex haley. it taught me a little bit about the strong will
~~that most muslims possess, myself included. it also introduced me to
~~allah. i had never heard of allah in his real form until i read that
~~book and i was very curious. i then started reading about the nation of
~~islam (specifically malcolm x) and it fascinated me how devoted he was
~~to allah, especially after he left the self serving nation of islam.
~~reading about malcolm made me think about a god who (for a change) did
~~not have any physical form or limitations and, being a totally blind
~~person, it made me relate to these people: the people who malcolm and
~~haley referred to as muslims. i continued reading what i could about
~~islam which wasn't as much as it should have been. my reading material
~~was very limited because like i said above: i am a totally blind person
~~and the material available about islam in braille or on tape was not
~~only very little, but also very general. PageV02P0298
# i believe the reason was that the material that i had access to wasn't
~~written by muslims and it kind of painted a dark picture of islam. i
~~think most of the literature written by christians or non muslims about
~~islam tends to do that most of the time. and i didn't know that their
~~were even muslims in halifax so i obviously didn't know any. i didn't
~~even know about the local islamic association until i was already a
~~muslim. so, i read what i could until my first year out of high school
~~around the month of may, 1996, when i received a phone call asking me if
~~i wanted to participate in a camp for blind and visually impaired people
~~known throughout canada as score. i agreed and sent them a resume and
~~praise be to allah i was excepted for work. at first i really didn't
~~want to go but something kept telling me it would be a good idea if i
~~went. so, on june 30th 1996 i boarded a plane from nova scotia to
~~toronto and took my last trip as a non muslim; i just didn't know it
~~yet. i got to toronto and everything at first was pretty normal... it
~~was on the second day that i was there when the journey of a thousand
~~miles first started. i arrived on a sunday and on the next day i met the
~~person who allah would use with his divine power to help guide me to the
~~beautiful religion of islam. i met a sister named rizvana and if she
~~reads this i hope she doesn't get mad at me for using her name. when i
~~met her, i immediately wanted to talk to her because i liked her name.
~~PageV02P0299
# i asked her of what origin her name was and she told me that it was
~~arabic; so i asked her if she was muslim and she replied with the answer
~~of yes. i immediately started telling her what i already knew about
~~islam which lasted about ten seconds. i started asking her questions and
~~also asking her to talk to me about islam. one particular incident that
~~comes to my mind is when all of the workers at the camp went to a
~~baseball game and the sister and i started talking about islam and
~~missed pretty much the whole game. well, anyways, we talked for about
~~three, maybe four days on and off about islam and on july the fifth if
~~my memory doesn't fail me i became a muslim. my life has been totally
~~different ever since. i look at things very differently than i used to
~~and i finally feel like i belong to a family. all muslims are brothers
~~and sisters in islam so i could say that i have approximately 1.2
~~billion brothers and sisters all of whom i'm proud to be related to. i
~~finally know what it feels like to be humble and to worship a god that i
~~don't have to see. for any non muslim reading this just look at it this
~~way. it's good to learn, but you never know when you will be tested and
~~if you're not in the class at the time of the final exam no matter how
~~much you know you'll never get any credit. so like i said it's good to
~~learn but if you want to get credit sign up for the class. in other
~~words, declare shehada (testimony to faith) and let allah teach you
~~everything you need to know. believe me the reward is worth it. you
~~could say the reward is literally heaven. PageV02P0300
# if any good comes out of this story all the credit is due to allah;
~~only the mistakes are my own. i would like to mention a part of a hadith
~~that has had a great effect on me and that is: "worship allah as if you
~~see him and if you don't see him, know that he sees you." - sahih

~~rendrabwana PageV02P0301
# kusmari rendrabwana kusmari rendrabwana childhood i was born and
~~brought up into a devoted catholic family. my father comes from a family
~~whose members mostly turned out to become priests and priestesses, while
~~my mother still has a certain aristocratic blood in her family. my
~~parents were blessed with five children, of which i am the only male and
~~the youngest one. i never had anyone of them to play with since i was a
~~child because of the quite significant difference in age, they were
~~always occupied with their school tasks whenever i needed someone to
~~play with. as it turned out to be, i got used to spending my time with
~~the maidservant and when i was bored, i simply went out to play. for
~~that reason i was used to make friends with people outside of my family,
~~people in my neighborhood who were mostly muslims. in my family,
~~everything that has a "muslim taste" in it was usually considered
~~inappropriate. so every thursday when the time was for the recitation of
~~the qur'an (we only had tvri, the government's station back then) the tv
~~set was immediately turned off, that's how my family was like. when i
~~got to school age, naturally my parents chose a catholic institution, as
~~with all my sisters. even so, i alwasy found it easier to be friends
~~mostlye with people who were muslim. adolescence perhaps it was because
~~of my negative childhood image, that when i grew up to be a teen-ager my
~~family always thought of me as being this troublesome kid. in other
~~words, to them i was always the one to blame for everything, anything
~~good that i did was practically nothing to them. PageV02P0302
# hence, i always tried to look up for answers of my problems through
~~sources outside of my family. my academic records were also nothing
~~special except for english language. and so i started to contemplate
~~with questions that i had in my high school year, i asked and kept
~~asking, i read many books and literature, trying to explore everything
~~about my faith then. but as it goes, the more i gained something, the
~~more i felt that, "this isn't it, this is not what i want." what's worse
~~is that the more i involved myself with religious activities, the more i
~~went further from what i expected, which put me down more and more. what
~~i always found in there was nothing but negative views on somebody
~~else's faith. whenever i tried to give in another view, they put me down
~~saying that i'm taking sides, i'm giving too much of a value judgement,
~~so on and so forth. eventually i became more distanced from them, but
~~interestingly (and this is what had always happenned) i felt myself
~~drawn closer and closer with my muslim friends, they seemed to accept me
~~without any sort of tendency to judge. they knew i didn't share their
~~faith but most of them didn't seem to mind or be disturbed by it
~~whatsoever. adulthood my adulthood started when i entered college. i
~~enrolled in a private college whose students were predominantly muslims.
~~even so, i still tried to involve myself in religious activities with
~~students of the same faith. in that community, the old conflicting
~~trauma appeared afresh, even worse. eventually i lost my interest in it.
~~PageV02P0303
# as a college student, i felt more comfortable in my soul searching
~~process. naturally, i had more access to many references, times and
~~places of interest, because i never felt home with my relatives, even
~~with my sisters. and so i went on with my life as usual, until this deep
~~spiritual experience happened. this is the story: one morning, i don't
~~remember the date, but it was in 1993. i was abruptly awoke from sleep
~~and just quickly sat down. then unconsciously went up and washed my
~~face, hands and feet, then got back sitting with my legs crossed.
~~exactly then the call to fajr prayer started..but very differently. i
~~listened to it with an indescribable feeling and emotion,..it was
~~touching me so deeply, in short. i myself never could explain what
~~really happened that morning, but so it did. ever since then i looked
~~for answers and learned with a practicing muslim friend, read books,
~~started everything from scratch. the first obstacle for me naturally
~~came from my family, especially my mother. i became uncertain again,
~~this is the most difficult choice in my entire life. and so months i
~~spent trying to think over my intention to become a muslim. i felt that
~~i had to make a choice. and of course i chose to become a muslim
~~eventually. in early 1994 i declared my shahadah after finishing the
~~maghrib (evening) prayer in jama'ah (congregation). it was really
~~emotional, friends from my faculty in college even made me work out a
~~written statement with them as witnesses, how touchy it was. in short,
~~i've lived my life as a new person ever since then. PageV02P0304
# after finishing my school, i started working. even though my
~~relationship with my family is falling apart, i try to pull everything
~~together and be strong as to endure the hardships. my new life was again
~~put to a test when i was going to marry. because i'm considered an
~~apostate in my family's view, i had to do everything by myself, the
~~proposal, etc., everything. no wedding reception or any of that sort,
~~just the obligatory ones. and then when my mother died, unfortunately i
~~didn't get to see her for the last time. her wish, which of course i
~~cannot comply to, was for me to return to my old faith. wassalaamu

# ibrahim karlsson i was born in an ordinary , non-religious swedish
~~home, but with a very loving relationship to each other. i had lived my
~~life 25 years without really thinking about the existence of god or
~~anything spiritual what-so-ever; i was the role model of the
~~materialistic man. or was i? i recall a short story i wrote in 7th
~~grade, something about my future life, where i portray myself as a
~~successful games programmer (i hadn't yet even touched a computer) and
~~living with a muslim wife!! ok, at that time muslim to me meant dressing
~~in long clothes and wearing a scarf, but i have no idea where those
~~thoughts came from. later, in high school, i remember spending much time
~~in the school-library (being a bookworm) and at one time i picked up a
~~translated qur'an and read some passages from it. i don't remember
~~exactly what i read, but i do remember finding that what it said made
~~sense and was logical to me. still, i was not at all religious, i
~~couldn't fit god in my universe, and i had no need of any god. i mean,
~~we have newton to explain how the universe works, right? time passed, i
~~graduated and started working. earned some money and moved to my own
~~apartment, and found a wonderful tool in the pc. i became a passionate
~~amateur photographer, and enrolled in activities around that. at one
~~time i was ********ing a marketplace, taking snapshots from a distance
~~with my telelens when an angry looking immigrant came over and explained
~~that he would make sure i wasn't going to take any more pictures of his
~~mum and sisters. strange people those muslims... PageV02P0306
# more things related to islam happened that i can't explain why i did
~~what i did. i can't recall the reason i called the "islamic information
~~organisation" in sweden, ordering a sub******ion to their newsletter,
~~buying yosuf ali's qur'an and a very good book on islam called islam -
~~our faith. i just did! i read almost all of the qur'an, and found it to
~~be both beautiful and logical, but still, god had no place in my heart.
~~one year later, whilst out on a patch of land called "pretty island" (it
~~really is) taking autumn-color pictures, i was overwhelmed by a
~~fantastic feeling. i felt as if i were a tiny piece of something
~~greater, a tooth on a gear in god's great gearbox called the universe.
~~it was wonderful! i had never ever felt like this before, totally
~~relaxed, yet bursting with energy, and above all, total awareness of god
~~wherever i turned my eyes. i don't know how long i stayed in this
~~ecstatic state, but eventually it ended and i drove home, seemingly
~~unaffected, but what i had experienced left uneraseable marks in my
~~mind. at this time microsoft brought ******s-95 to the market with the
~~biggest marketing blitz known to the computer industry. part of the
~~package was the on-line service the microsoft network. and keen to know
~~what is was i got myself an account on the msn. i soon found that the
~~islam bbs were the most interesting part of the msn, and that's where i
~~found shahida. shahida is a american woman, who like me has converted to
~~islam. our chemistry worked right away, and she became the best pen-
~~friend i have ever had. PageV02P0307
# our e-mail correspondence will go down in history: the fact that my
~~mailbox grew to something like 3 megabytes over the first 6 months tells
~~its own tale. she and i discussed a lot about islam and faith in god in
~~general, and what she wrote made sense to me. shahida had an angels
~~patience with my slow thinking and my silly questions, but she never
~~gave up the hope in me. just listen to your heart and you'll find the
~~truth she said. and i found the truth in myself sooner than i'd
~~expected. on the way home from work, in the bus with most of the people
~~around me asleep, and myself adoring the sunset, painting the
~~beautifully dispersed clouds with pink and orange colours, all the parts
~~came together, how god can rule our life, yet we're not robots. how i
~~could depend on physics and chemistry and still believe and see gods
~~work. it was wonderful, a few minutes of total understanding and peace.
~~i so long for a moment like this to happen again! and it did, one
~~morning i woke up, clear as a bell, and the first thought that ran
~~through my brain was how grateful to god i were that he made me wake up
~~to another day full of opportunities. it was so natural, like i had been
~~doing every day of my life! after these experiences i couldn't no longer
~~deny god's existence. but after 25 years of denying god it was no easy
~~task to admit his existence and accept faith. but good things kept
~~happening to me, i spent some time in the us, and at this time i started
~~praying, testing and feeling, learning to focus on god and to listen to
~~what my heart said. PageV02P0308
# it all ended in a nice weekend in new york, of which i had worried a
~~lot, but it turned out to be a success, most of all, i finally got to
~~meet shahida! at this point there was no return, i just didn't know it
~~yet. but god kept leading me, i read some more, and finally got the
~~courage to call the nearest mosque and ask for a meeting with some
~~muslims. with trembling legs i drove to the mosque, which i had passed
~~many times before, but never dared to stop and visit. i met the nicest
~~people there, and i was given some more reading material, and made plans
~~to come and visit the brothers in their home. what they said, and the
~~answers they gave all made sense. islam became a major part of my life,
~~i started praying regularly, and i went to my first jumma prayer. it was
~~wonderful, i sneaked in, and sat in the back, not understanding a word
~~the imam was saying, but still enjoying the service. after the khutba we
~~all came together forming lines, and made the two 'rakaas'. it was yet
~~one of the wonderful experiences i have had on my journey to islam. the
~~sincerity of 200 men fully devoted to just one thing, to praise god,
~~felt great! slowly my mind started to agree with my heart, i started to
~~picture myself as a muslim, but could i really convert to islam? i had
~~left the swedish state-church earlier, just in case, but to pray 5 times
~~a day? to stop eating pork? could i really do that? and what about my
~~family and friends? i recalled what br. omar told me, how his family
~~tried to get him admitted to an asylum when he converted. PageV02P0309
# could i really do this? by this time the internet wave had swept my
~~country, and i too had hooked up with the infobahn. and "out there" were
~~tons of information about islam. i think i collected just about every
~~web page with the word islam anywhere in the ****, and learned a lot.
~~but what really made a change was a **** i found in great britain, a
~~story of a newly converted woman with feelings exactly like mine. 12
~~hours is the name of the ****. when i had read that story, and wept the
~~tears out of my eyes i realized that there were no turning back anymore,
~~i couldn't resist islam any longer. summer vacation started, and i had
~~made my mind up. i had to become a muslim! but after all, the start of
~~the summer had been very cold, and if my first week without work was
~~different, i wouldn't lose a day of sunshine by not being on the beach.
~~on the tv the weatherman painted a big sun right on top of my part of
~~the country. ok then, some other day... the next morning; a steel grey
~~sky, with ice-cold gusts of wind outside my bedroom ******. it was like
~~god had decided my time was up, i could wait no longer. i had the
~~required bath, and dressed in clean clothes, jumped in my car and drove
~~the 1 hour drive to the mosque. in the mosque i approached the brothers
~~with my wish, and after dhuhr prayer the imam and some brothers
~~witnessed me say the shahada. alhamdulillah! and to my great relief all
~~my family and friends have taken my conversion very well, they have all
~~accepted it, i won't say they were thrilled, but absolutely no hard
~~feelings. they can't understand all the things i do. PageV02P0310
# like praying 5 times a day on specific times, or not eating pork meat.
~~they think this is strange foreign customs that will die out with time,
~~but i'll prove them wrong. inshaallah! source

~~pradarelli david pradarelli assalam-aleikum wa rahmatullah! i came to
~~islam pretty much on my own. i was born and raised roman catholic, but i
~~always had a deep fascination with the spiritualities of other cultures.
~~my journey started when i desired to have a relationship with my
~~creator. i wanted to find my spirituality, and not the one i was born
~~with. i spent some time in the catholic religious order known as the
~~franciscans. i had many friends and i enjoyed prayer times, but it just
~~seemed to relaxed in its faith, and there was, in my opinion, too much
~~arrogance and hypocrisy. when i had returned back from the order into
~~secular living again, i once again was searching for my way to reach god
~~(allah). one night i was watching the news on television, and of course
~~they were continuing their one-sided half-truth reports on muslims
~~(always in a negative light instead of balancing it by showing the
~~positive side as well) with images of violence and terrorism. i decided
~~long ago that the news media has no morals whatsoever and will trash
~~anyone for that "juicy story", and i pretty much refused to believe
~~anything they said. i decided to research islam for myself and draw my
~~own conclusions. what i found paled all the negative images that the
~~satanic media spewed forth. PageV02P0311
# i found a religion deep in love and spiritual truth, and constant god-
~~mindfullness. what may be fanatacism to one person may be devotion to
~~another. i picked up a small paperback qur'an and began devouring
~~everything i could. it opened my eyes to the wonder and mercy of allah,
~~and i found the fascination growing every day...it was all i could think
~~about. no other religion including catholicism impacted me in such a
~~powerful way...i actually found myself in god-awareness 24 hours a day 7
~~days a week...each time i went to my five daily prayers, i went with
~~anticipation...finally! what i have been searching for all of my life. i
~~finally got enough courage to go to a mosque and profess the shahadah
~~before my muslm brothers and sisters. i now am a practicing muslim and i
~~thank allah for leading me to this place: ashhahdu anna la ilaha ilallah
~~wa muhammadur rasul allah! this means: "i believe in the oneness and
~~totalness of allah and that muhammad(peace and blessings be upon him)is
~~the chosen prophet of allah." i now also accept jesus as no longer equal
~~with allah, but sent as muhammad was sent ...to bring all of mankind to
~~submission to the will of allah! may all of mankind find the light and
~~truth of allah. february 25, 1997 source
